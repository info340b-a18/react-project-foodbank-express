Without them I might be slimmer, but also crazier and more unhappy. Judging by the crowds at the Metro Diner, on 100th Street and Broadway, my current haunt, I suspect that other New Yorkers feel the same way. To say that the Metro has become my second home would be too vague and sentimental. Better to use the sociological term \u201cthe third place\u201d (home and work being the first two) or to quote Robert Frost, the place \u201cwhere, when you have to go   They have to take you in. \u201d American coffee shops, like English pubs, Viennese coffee houses and Greek kaffenions, tend to engender klatches, informal clubs. At the old Key West Diner on 94th Street and Broadway, now known as the Manhattan Diner, the laughter of the comedian Anne Meara and her friends used to fill the room. And where would the sitcom classic \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d the idea of which was conceived in a coffee shop, have been without the regular scenes at Monk\u2019s Caf\u00e9? The best days of the New York City diner, however, appear to be over. Among the 2016 casualties were the Lyric Diner in Gramercy and the    Del Rio in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, while La Parisienne near Columbus Circle and the    Market Diner in Hell\u2019s Kitchen closed in 2015. Then there was Cafe Edison, a    coffee shop that shut in 2014 to much sadness in the Broadway community. Manhattan has certainly seen more diner closings than other boroughs. That said, with rising costs in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods, classic diners like the Neptune and Bel Aire, both in Astoria, Queens, could soon be under threat. In Downtown Brooklyn, the building that has housed the original Junior\u2019s Restaurant since 1950 was almost sold. But after considering several offers, the owner Alan Rosen decided that the community still needed cheesecake more than luxury  . Urban renewal, astronomical rents, changing eating habits and the preponderance of   coffee places like Starbucks have all contributed to the demise of the New York diner. There are roughly half as many as there were 20 years ago, according to records from the health department. Losing New York diner culture would probably be a watershed in the city\u2019s history. How will New Yorkers get along without these antidotes to urban loneliness? \u201cThe coffee shop orients us here, in this city and not another,\u201d Jeremiah Moss, of the blog Jeremiah\u2019s Vanishing New York, said. \u201cIf we are regulars, we become known, connected, to a network of people who remain over the span of years, even decades. In the anonymous city, these ties can be lifesavers, especially for the elderly, the poor, the marginal, but also for all of us. Without them, the city becomes evermore fragmented, disorienting and unrecognizable. \u201d The Metro is a treasure trove of local history. It is in one of the few   buildings left in Manhattan. Built by the grocer Henry Grimm in 1871, it was bought in 1894 by the brewer Peter Doelger. He turned the ground floor into a restaurant and saloon, with families entering through the back while gentlemen drank beer in the front. (Around the same time, Mr. Doelger\u2019s cousin Matilda married a prizefighter, John West, whose daughter Mae  \u2014   yes, the Mae West  \u2014   may have picked up some of her unconventional performance style from hanging around the Doelger bar.) Over the course of its existence, the Grimm building also housed a milliner\u2019s shop, a tearoom and, in the 1950s, the rehearsal studio and offices of the   Living Theater. The sociologist Ray Oldenburg, in \u201cThe Great Good Place,\u201d a book about diners and taverns, suggests that the past is an essential element of all third places, which are usually in older sections of cities, and in those areas \u201cexists the fading image of the city itself and the kind of human interaction, the easy and interesting mixing of strangers that made the city what it was. \u201d But not only what it was. One of the charms of the Metro, and of many other diners in the city, is that the employees\u2019 backgrounds are as varied as the languages spoken by the tourists who have found their way here. Costa Rica, Ecuador, Greece, Mexico, Poland, Romania  \u2014   these are just a few of the countries where staff members come from. Together they constitute a microcosm of the immigrant groups that continue to arrive in New York  \u2014   who not only made the city what it was, but the best of what it is and could be. My first diner nesting place was Harvey\u2019s Coffee Shop on 78th and Broadway, in Manhattan, where I would order matzo ball soup and a Coke after seeing my therapist across the street. Harvey was known for his   Puerto Rican countermen and for serving deliciously seasoned chopped meat on white bread. After Harvey\u2019s closed, I moved to the Utopia on 73rd and Amsterdam, a venerable place with a low ceiling,   murals and waiters who seemed to never age. As my thighs outgrew the narrow booths, I moved to the Central Park   at 97th and Columbus. In the 1990s, the Cafe replaced Mikell\u2019s, a beloved jazz and    club. This was the liveliest of my hangouts. Every morning a group of retired men in baseball caps, along with a spirited Jayne Mansfield   heckled one another and batted sports statistics back and forth for hours. The music of their banter was pure Bach counterpoint. After the Cafe succumbed in 2005, I spent months looking for my next \u201cthird place. \u201d Diner regulars can be particular. The ambience has to be friendly but not intrusive, the sound level low but not funereal, the smell a little greasy but not cloying, and the d\u00e9cor more utilitarian than fussy. I eventually settled in at the Metro. Among diners, the Metro is quietly sophisticated. The d\u00e9cor is   Art Deco, the booths spacious. There is a generous, though tasteful, use of diner decorator staples like vinyl, Formica and chrome. Politicians, including former Gov. David A. Paterson of New York and the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, have been spotted in the booths. The hostess, Jenny Bello, wears outfits that could rival the wardrobe collection from    studios in the 1950s. Fanis Tsiamtsiouris, known as Frank, and Fotios Hilas own the Metro along with three other diners. They calculated that the Metro poured about 700 cups of coffee, made 150 hamburgers and used over 1, 200 eggs every day. The place opened in 1989, when Mr. Tsiamtsiouris consolidated five stores, among them a kosher butcher, a copy store and a   restaurant. Though diners are sometimes bought by other enterprising immigrants, many of the surviving ones are still owned by  . Historians differ on how and when Greek immigrants got into the business, but they agree that a growth spurt occurred right after World War II. Their story is a classic American one that combines entrepreneurs putting in long hours, families helping one another and informal associations creating a safety net of connections. \u201cWhen my family came over in 1967, we had an $8, 000 debt to pay, so we all went to work,\u201d Mr. Tsiamtsiouris said. \u201cSo first I was a cleanup guy, then busboy, then a waiter, then a manager. \u201d He had one uncle in the business when he started out, he recalled, and he met many other owners through Pan Gregorian, a food industry cooperative. In the back of the Metro\u2019s long room, the area is set up with small tables for regulars like me who linger over breakfast. Rosa and Dumitra, Diana and John, and Enid and Fabiano know what we\u2019re going to order, but pretend to let us decide. For years the unofficial queen of the Metro was Batyah Hyman, also known as Betty, a beautiful,   Swedish and South African woman who sat at the head of the room. I don\u2019t remember how we drifted into conversation  \u2014   probably a political issue that we disagreed about. Somehow we sensed that we could be friends, or at least \u201caffiliated,\u201d the way Mr. Oldenburg, the sociologist, described friendship among regulars at a place like the Metro. She lives around the corner, but Ms. Hyman no longer eats breakfast at the Metro. She drops by from time to time, and the waitress Rosa Soto babysits her grandchildren. Nobody has dared to claim her table. A few years ago, one of my oldest friends, the political scientist and philosopher Marshall Berman, died in the Metro. An eloquent writer about New York neighborhoods, I think he would have appreciated his heart\u2019s choice of where to expire.","1":"BEIJING  \u2014   China\u2019s leaders thought they had a solution to the torrent of snark, jibes and condemnation on Twitter: They banned access to it at home. Yet China has become the country that   Donald J. Trump seems to enjoy criticizing the most on his    Twitter feed. In bursts of 140 characters or less, he has jabbed at Beijing over Taiwan, trade, the South China Sea and, most recently, North Korea. \u201cChina has been taking out massive amounts of money  wealth from the U. S. in totally   trade, but won\u2019t help with North Korea. Nice!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Monday. How and when President Xi Jinping reads about these broadsides remains a mystery to outsiders. Translating Mr. Trump\u2019s sarcasm  \u2014   \u201cNice!\u201d  \u2014   could be tricky. But Chinese officials and the state news media want Mr. Trump to know that their leaders prefer doing diplomacy the   way, behind closed doors and muffled in platitudes. Xinhua, the state news agency, has more or less asked Mr. Trump to shut up. \u201cAn obsession with \u2018Twitter foreign policy\u2019 is undesirable,\u201d read the headline of  a Xinhua commentary on Tuesday about Mr. Trump\u2019s posts. \u201cEveryone recognizes the common sense that foreign policy isn\u2019t child\u2019s play, and even less is it like doing business deals,\u201d said the article, published after Mr. Trump\u2019s latest barbed comments on China. \u201cTwitter shouldn\u2019t become an instrument of foreign policy,\u201d the article said. Earlier that day, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s accusation that Beijing had coddled North Korea. But the article acknowledged that it was probably too late to detach Mr. Trump from Twitter. Mr. Trump\u2019s designated press secretary, Sean Spicer, has indicated that Mr. Trump will keep using the terse, punchy format after he settles in the White House. \u201cIssuing tweets has become a habit for Mr. Trump,\u201d Xinhua noted. Mr. Trump, it said, appeared to assume that \u201cissuing   comments and taking up sensitive issues may perhaps add to his chips for negotiating with other countries. \u201d Mr. Xi is most unlikely to joust directly with Mr. Trump on Twitter. The service has been banned in China since 2009, though residents find ways to poke through the firewall of censorship. And while Chinese politicians love slogans, they prefer to communicate with foreign leaders through long, tranquilizing disquisitions. Open sarcasm is rare. Sad!","2":"\u2019  \u2019 \u2019   Learning how to survive on practically no food, with no   electricity, while surrounded by snipers and targeted in   airstrikes, has become a necessary part of daily life for those   still inside the besieged Syrian city of Aleppo. \u2019 \u201d   In  former University of Aleppo   student Omair Shaaban described the measures residents have to   take just to survive    in the city they\u2019ve lived in   their entire lives. \u201d \u2019   Those include living on the lower floors of buildings to survive   \u201dthe many different kinds of airstrikes, shells, rockets,   phosphorus bombs and cluster bombs\u201d; stay off the street as much   as possible; drive without headlights to avoid being targeted (if   you own a car); sell any extra pasta and bread you may be given   by aid organizations (\u201dthere is no meat, no milk, no yogurt\u201d);   and, above all, try to stay calm. \u2019 \u2019   \u201dHearing bombs going off all the time is hard,\u201d Shaaban wrote.   \u201dThey\u2019re so noisy  \u2014   the sound alone could drive you crazy. So now   I try to ignore it. If bombs detonate nearby, try to forget them,   try to be calm. Go save your neighbors instead of panicking. If   you aren\u2019t calm, you will really go mad.\u201d \u2019 \u2019   Late last month, the Syrian government  \u2014   backed by Russian   warplanes  \u2014   launched its most devastating bombing campaign on   Aleppo since the civil war began more than five years ago. \u2019 \u2019   \u201dThe destruction is so complete that it obliterates even a sense   of time,\u201d Michael Kimmelman recently. \u2019 \u2019  \u2019 \u201d   Earlier this month,    argued in  that Russia\u2019s current tactics in Aleppo can be   understood by studying what Moscow did to the Chechen capital of   Grozny 16 years ago. \u201d \u2019   Much like Aleppo is today, Grozny was encircled by     forces before being obliterated. In Grozny, though, an estimated   50, 000 people were trapped as bombs rained down on them. Four   times as many people, roughly 250, 000, are under siege in     eastern Aleppo today, according to reports. \u2019 \u2019   \u201dIt\u2019s so easy to lose your mind here,\u201d Shabaan wrote. He noted   that going out to look for food, which is scarce and expensive,   is risky because \u201dyou might come back to find that your building   has been destroyed and your family killed.\u201d \u201dI\u2019ve seen people   standing in front of   buildings, screaming and crying   in disbelief. .. \u2019 \u2019  \u2019 \u2019   US Secretary of State John Kerry has called for Russia and the   Syrian government to be  over reports that their warplanes   are targeting hospitals and rescue workers inside the city  \u2014     reports that the Kremlin and Syrian president Bashar     continue to deny. \u2019 \u2019   \u201dWe look forward today to a very frank discussion about what   potential next steps are,\u201d . \u201dWe intend to jointly figure out how best to be   able to deliver the strongest message possible about the actions   that might be taken to deal with this bombing of Aleppo, this   siege, in the 21st century, of innocent people.\u201d \u2019 \u2019   Russia temporarily halted its airstrikes on Aleppo on Thursday   and Friday, but has not specified how long the temporary   ceasefire will last. \u2019 \u2019   \u201dThis past week, the regime and the Russians\u201d Shabaan wrote. \u201dBut that has made   everyone afraid  \u2014   we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to come next. Maybe   the attacks will be worse than before, when they start again.   That\u2019s what happened last time.\u201d \u2019","3":"President Donald Trump\u2019s new bipartisan commission on voting security can use federal data to help resolve the bitter partisan dispute about the reality of   fraudulent voting, Commission   Kris Kobach told Breitbart News. [\u201cThe issue of voting fraud often gets politicized, and people are making statements with few foundations [of fact, so] this commission will provide a firm foundation [of] information and facts that are verifiable about the issues surrounding voter fraud,\u201d said Kobach, who is the Kansas Secretary of State and is a   opponent of voters fraud and illegal immigration.   \u201cThe states are in the drivers\u2019 seat, but this commission can offer recommendations and evidence\u201d for state legislators to debate, he added, adding that many state elections are decided by fewer than 50 votes.  Koch is   of the panel, which is run by Vice President Mike Pence. The panel is expected to include Democrats, but progressive pressure groups are calling for a Democratic boycott.  The commission is vital because it can use federal data about peoples\u2019 citizenship to help states check the eligibility of people on their voting rolls, Kobach said. \u201cThe federal government has a database of all known   residing in or visiting the United States   \u2026     never before has that database been used to run [checks] against the databases of voter rolls in each state,\u201d he said.  Some states have asked for federal data to check their   but \u201cwe\u2019ve always been turned down\u201d by the federal government, said Kobach. Election watchers in several states, including Texas and Virginia, have concerns about ineligible voters on their rolls, he said.  In part, vote fraud is important because \u201cclose races happen all the time,\u201d he said, adding that Kansas has had more than 20 elections for federal or state seats over the last 20 years which were decided by fewer than 50 votes. \u201cThat\u2019s true all across the country,\u201d he said, adding that the panel won\u2019t be looking back at prior elections.  Voter fraud is a moral issue, said Kobach. \u201cThere\u2019s a broader principle  \u2014   every time  there is a fraudulent vote, it effectively cancels out a legitimately cast vote by the U. S. citizen. \u201d But the new bipartisan commission is already being scorched by the Democrats\u2019   coalition, including the ACLU, which is pressuring Democrats to boycott the bipartisan panel.  \u201cAs President Trump\u2019s own lawyers have said, \u2018All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake,\u2019\u201d said a statement from Dale Ho, director of the ACLU\u2019s voting rights office. He continued: This commission, to be   by King of Voter Suppression Kris Kobach, is a sham. We call on professional elections administrators, serious academics, and elected officials to refuse to participate in what will be a pretext for disenfranchising Americans. Ho also urged voting rules be loosened to encourage higher election turnout, saying \u201cthe United States has one of the lowest turnout rates in the developed world, and we should be doing everything we can to encourage more people, not fewer, to participate in our democracy. \u201d Kobach\u2019s   measures in Kansas have prompted angry criticism and lawsuits from progressive groups. For example, the ACLU is suing Kobach\u2019s office to detail his   measures, including a requirement that people prove their citizenship when registering to vote, and show identification when voting. Those   measures have improperly pushed 30, 000 people off the voting rolls, and have halted registration by an additional 35, 000 people, claims the ACLU. Chris Carson, the national president of the League of Women Voters, told the Kansas City Star that the commission is \u201cpart of a wider effort to suppress the vote, keep certain politicians in power, and undermine our elections by spreading falsehoods. \u201d The Democrats\u2019 hostility to Kobach is offset by praise from other lawyers. \u201cI\u2019ve had the pleasure to debate him on voting issues and have found that he is a knowledgeable and engaging advocate,\u201d said Mark Johnson, a Kanas City attorney who is leading a lawsuit to overturn Kobach\u2019s   rules. \u201cKobach is an honorable public servant and as such, I hope he will put aside any personal beliefs and participate in the investigation with an open mind. \u201d The commission\u2019s \u201cjob is to look at the problem, collect data, and see where the facts are and make some recommendations,\u201d said Kobach. Only legislators in the states have the power to change or preserve their voting systems, he said, because \u201celections are under the control of the states [according to] the constitution. \u201d ","4":"August 30, 2016, Nature takes center stage on today\u2019s edition of our show.

The road crests just before it intersects Boulevard, at a traffic light that always seems to glow red, as if to allow motorists a minute to savor the panorama before them. The striking thing is not the majesty of the skyline but its accessibility  \u2014   here I am, the city beckons, come and gawk. For from that vantage point, Atlanta just is: a   mecca, the cradle of the civil rights movement, a magnet for transplants, a college football locus, the shimmering capital of the South, and more. All of which are accurate but still do not capture the city\u2019s nuances. \u201cI don\u2019t think people understand Atlanta,\u201d Doug Hertz said. Aside from his schooling at Tulane, in New Orleans, Hertz, 64, has lived here his entire life, which makes him a rarity. The city teems with people who moved here for work, school, family, or just to live nearer to the spinach and sausage meatloaf at Murphy\u2019s. They have contributed to a booming growth  \u2014   the metropolitan area\u2019s diverse population has swelled to more than 5. 7 million, an increase of more than 1. 46 million since 2000  \u2014   that over the past few decades has also shaped Atlanta\u2019s layered relationship with its sports teams. Hertz is a limited partner of the Falcons, who on Sunday will play the New England Patriots in the team\u2019s second Super Bowl appearance since its inception in 1966. They last reached the championship game in the 1998 season, losing to the Denver Broncos, when I was a freshman at Emory University here and, more to the point, was one of those people Hertz was talking about, struggling to understand Atlanta. That September, I joined surprising brigades of Philadelphia Eagles fans invading the Georgia Dome for the Falcons\u2019 home opener. Not even three weeks later, a group of us arrived at Turner Field, maybe two hours before Game 1 of the Atlanta Braves\u2019 baseball playoff series against the Chicago Cubs, and still managed to buy tickets. Six of them. In the same row. My frame of reference was Philadelphia, whose zealous fans in analogous circumstances would never accept such apathy. Season after season, the Braves won their division, destroying the Phillies, and this is how their fans responded? \u201cAre we as rabid and overtly   like Boston or New York? No, we could be better,\u201d Gavin Godfrey, a native Atlanta journalist who chronicles culture and sports  said over lunch in Castleberry Hill, a historic arts district by the Georgia Dome. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t care, and not every town has to be held to that standard. Not every city\u2019s built the same. \u201d In the Northeast, for instance, with a deep and abiding sports culture that spans generations, and in some cases centuries, there is less competition for sports fans\u2019 loyalty. The emotional connection with college football, for instance, is not as strong as it is with some professional sports. For years, the opposite has been  \u2014   and to a degree, still is  \u2014   true of Atlanta, where on autumn Saturdays fans pack bars and living rooms, or flee for Georgia, Alabama, Auburn, Clemson, South Carolina, Tennessee, all within a   drive. \u201cMost of us, that D. N. A. is not there for professional sports franchises,\u201d Hertz said. The Falcons have built a base of loyalists  \u2014   the City Council president, Ceasar Mitchell, said he drove down to Miami for the Falcons\u2019 last Super Bowl appearance despite not having a ticket  \u2014   but so struggled to pack the Dome that home games were not shown on local television because of the N. F. L. \u2019s old blackout rule. The team\u2019s middling history has also failed to entice the local residents and persuade the newcomers to come out. The arrival of the quarterback Michael Vick, in 2001, mirrored the city\u2019s spirit at the time  \u2014   ascending, vibrant and   forward  \u2014   and his downfall, for his involvement in an interstate dogfighting ring, created tension, on a racial and cultural level, that lingered for years. Vick\u2019s successor, Matt Ryan, is his antithesis in nearly every possible way  \u2014   be it race, playing style, pedigree or personality. \u201cSome of our fans will always be proud that an   quarterback succeeded,\u201d Hertz said. \u201cWhat I think has happened over a period of time is a growing appreciation and acceptance in Matt Ryan, and that his style is every bit as spectacular on and off the field. \u201d The city\u2019s evolution, coupled with an effort by the owner of the Falcons, Arthur Blank, to promote a sense of community around the team, has strengthened its bond with the Falcons. Since 2012, when the Falcons lost in the conference championship game, the Georgia Dome, which seats 71, 250, has achieved at least 98 percent of its   capacity every year. This season\u2019s mark of 98. 2 percent, 15th among the 32 teams and the lowest since 2011, bested that of, among others, the venues for the Giants, Jets, Chiefs and Patriots. As the Braves bolt northwest for a new stadium in Cobb County, a move that has left many fans feeling betrayed, the Falcons remain moored to Atlanta. Next season they move into a new home,   Stadium. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the nature of fans here that makes them take pride,\u201d said Molly Slavin, 29, who moved here in 2012 from Illinois. \u201cAlthough it might not be in a way that translates to sports fandom as seen in other cities. \u201d Ryan Cameron, 47, an Atlanta radio personality and a   holder since 1998, explained that phenomenon like this: \u201cThere are people who will fight you about these Falcons,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not trying to prove to you that we\u2019re so crazy. For us, it\u2019s just being loud. We don\u2019t have to brag. It\u2019s Southern charm. \u201d Still, Atlanta\u2019s gentility, a core virtue, would give way to utter delirium on Sunday  \u2014   and for weeks and months thereafter  \u2014   if the Falcons were to win. This city has been teased before, by those Braves behemoths of the \u201990s, by the Falcons in 1998, even by the Hawks, who went   two seasons ago before losing in the conference finals. Counting the futility of its two departed N. H. L. franchises, the Flames and Thrashers, Atlanta can claim only one championship  \u2014   Braves, 1995  \u2014   across a combined 167 completed seasons. Pellom McDaniels, who played the final two of his eight N. F. L. seasons with the Falcons, suggested that a victory would register a psychological impact  \u2014   an acknowledgment of the city\u2019s trajectory, from aspirational to   and mature. During the 1996 Olympics, and in the years that followed, Atlanta seemed eager to convince others that it was cosmopolitan, sophisticated, worth exploring. Even as it grapples with its identity now, reckoning with gentrification and redevelopment forces that are at once eroding and improving neighborhoods, Atlanta projects a different image  \u2014   of comfort and confidence in its direction, whatever that is. \u201cIt would be almost like a beacon,\u201d said McDaniels, now the curator of   collections at Emory, said of a potential title. \u201cThat we\u2019re working together as a community, and the success the Falcons have experienced is our success  \u2014   that we\u2019re doing something right. \u201d The term Mitchell used was runway, a point of departure for a nascent sports city that has added a Major League Soccer franchise set to begin play next season. The Falcons are thriving, interest is soaring, and from Mitchell\u2019s perspective, he sure likes the view.","6":"(AP)  \u2014   Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union has reverberated through London\u2019s boisterous LGBT pride festival.

[\u201cIsrael\u2019s past experience has shown that the chant is often used in contexts outside of prayer. Accompanying riots and occasionally leading to terrorism and violence,\u201d the presiding judge, Shmuel Herbest, told the Hebrew language NRG news site.  The ruling harked back to an incident five years ago in which Sahar Ghazzawi fought a policeman off and broke his radio when he was escorted off the premises for yelling \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d at a group of Jews on the flashpoint holy site. Ghazzawi defended himself with the claim that he was not shouting at the Jews, rather he was saying the phrase as part of his religious ritual. He added that he struggled with the policeman because the latter refused his requests to go to the bathroom. However, a witness testified that Ghazzawi\u2019s chant was not a prayer but a way of goading Jews visiting the site. The report added that Ghazzawi may have been paid by the Islamist group Amarat   to visit the Temple Mount regularly in order to discourage Jews from coming. According to the judge, any utterances of \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d made during the proper times for prayer at a holy site constitutes a fundamental right. But when such chants are misappropriated in the context of riots or protest, they are considered a clear violation of peace. Herbest added that this issue is particularly acute on the Temple Mount  \u2014   the site of frequent clashes in Jerusalem  \u2014   and that any attempts at provocations will be judged harshly. The judge also said that Muslims are able to exercise far more rights  \u2014   including prayer, study, and free access to the complex  \u2014   on the Temple Mount than members of any other religion. \u201cAll [Ghazzawi] needed to do, then, was exercise his fundamental rights without harming the rights of other faiths. But he did not choose to do so,\u201d Herbest said. Soon after the ongoing wave of Palestinian violence against Israelis kicked off in September of last year, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared that the Jews \u201chave no right to defile [the   Mosque] with their filthy feet. \u201d","8":"German police today arrested two Algerian men reportedly linked to the Islamic State terror group during raids in Berlin, Hanover and Attendorn in the North   state.

The militant group Boko Haram, too, has been accused of setting fire to homes, but residents told us the military had now adopted the tactic as a way to clear the countryside so it could freely carry out operations against the insurgents. We saw the charred remains of villages when we flew over the area, but it was unclear who was responsible. In some places like this one, patches of farmland were burned. The military not long ago opened several main highways from Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State, leading to the rest of northeastern Nigeria, saying the area was now cleared of insurgents. Farmers who are living in squalid camps for displaced people in Maiduguri are anxious about the state of their fields. Because they have not been allowed back for years, they have no idea what awaits them on their farms. From the sky, Borno State, the region where Boko Haram is most active, is a patchwork of fallow farmland, swaths of desert and a few swampy areas.   conditions are raging in the area, a region with a rich history of agriculture. Boko Haram has chased off all the farmers, and the militants themselves have fallen victim to food shortages. We spotted only a handful of vehicles on the roads as we passed overhead. The area is mostly a ghost town. Every shade of beige is visible in this part of Nigeria. We think these are animal tracks, probably from cattle. Boko Haram is notorious for stealing cows to feed their group and to trade as a means of financial support. Most farmers who have livestock have cleared out, but nomadic herders pass through this part of Nigeria. Maybe the tracks are from motorbikes, which officials in Maiduguri banned after insurgents used them to begin attacks and carry out suicide bombings. Now, anyone spotted riding a motorbike is presumed to be a member of Boko Haram. This is part of a camp for displaced people in a community called Monguno. The town itself was once destroyed by Boko Haram, but military advances helped clear out insurgents, and now tens of thousands of people have poured in, looking for a safe place to wait out the yearslong insurgency. They live in ragged huts in a camp that is low on food supplies. More people arrive daily  \u2014   350 villagers came the day before we visited. Several recent arrivals told us the military had ordered them to leave their homes. One woman sent an envoy back to check on her house and received word that it had been burned to the ground. Lake Chad is not far from this area of Nigeria, and swamps emerge in a few spots, right next to farms. Besides farmers, fishermen have also fallen on hard times during the crisis. The military has largely banned the fish trade, fearing Boko Haram was profiting from it. We met one fisherman in the Monguno camp who had been sneaking back to a small lake to fish, then stuffing his catch in his pants in hopes of passing undetected on his way home. The military has a big garrison in Monguno, and soldiers keep watch in their vehicles on the outskirts of town. A berm has been constructed around the edges of the camp, which houses about 26, 000 displaced people. Mobile phone networks in Monguno have been cut and fuel stations are closed. Most farms are inoperable around here. Famine was declared in pockets of Borno State last year. Many communities are sealed off from safety as insurgents scatter from   in the forest, pushed out by recent military operations. Humanitarian groups face huge logistical challenges getting food and other supplies to people in need. Even roads the military says are safe now have been attacked by insurgents.","11":"WASHINGTON, D.

Here are some moments to remember: Soon after delivering a tremulous speech addressed to the TV audience (\u201cHate will never win\u201d) the Tonys host, James Corden, dove into a breathless   of 20 Broadway hits, concluding with some elegant hoofing to \u201cWe\u2019re in the Money\u201d from \u201c42nd Street. \u201d \u201cThink of tonight as the Oscars, but with diversity,\u201d Mr. Corden joked in his opening monologue. And the show delivered: In a first for Broadway, Tony voters gave the four musical performance awards to black actors: Cynthia Erivo of \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d and Leslie Odom Jr. Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry and Daveed Diggs of \u201cHamilton. \u201d In his acceptance speech for best score for \u201cHamilton,\u201d   Miranda provided the broadcast\u2019s emotional high point, reading a sonnet he had written that cited \u201csenseless acts of tragedy\u201d and included the repeated \u201cand love is love, is love, is love, is love\u201d that brought down the house. Asked later why he decided to address the situation this way, he said: \u201cWe live in this world where beautiful and horrible things exist at the same time. You can\u2019t let that go by, particularly when theater doesn\u2019t exist without the L. G. B. T. community. \u201d Not only did a pregnant Audra McDonald tap her heart out in the \u201cShuffle Along\u201d production number, she later presented the prize for best actress in a musical  \u2014   a category in which she was overlooked. With six Tonys already, it\u2019s easier to take things in stride. In winning best leading actor in a play for \u201cThe Father,\u201d Frank Langella tied Boyd Gaines for the most Tonys won by a male actor. He used his acceptance speech to movingly remember the victims of the massacre in Orlando, Fla. \u201cI\u2019m now a    man, and I react to things a lot more profoundly than I did when I was 60, when I was 50 or 40,\u201d Mr. Langella said. \u201cThis constant violence and sense of madness that seems to be pervading this country is terrifying. \u201d He continued: \u201cI urge you, Orlando, to be strong. I\u2019m standing in a room full of the most generous human beings on earth, and we will be with you every step of the way. \u201d Mr. Langella\u2019s other Tonys were for his roles in \u201cSeascape\u201d (1975) \u201cFortune\u2019s Fool\u201d (2002) and \u201c \u201d (2007). The costume designer William Ivey Long said he scrambled to make some 3, 000 commemorative ribbons in the basement of the Beacon Theater, where the ceremony was held. In an interview on the red carpet, Mr. Long said the ribbons were a small way for Broadway to show its support for the victims and their families in Orlando. \u201dYou\u2019re helpless because you\u2019re here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to open our arms and show love, that we understand. \u201d Mr. Diggs almost upstaged his own acceptance speech by wearing a jacket with gaudy patchwork sleeves that you almost couldn\u2019t take your eyes off. Meanwhile, Barbra Streisand\u2019s   look seemed almost a spoiler, giving the nod to \u201cHamilton\u201d as best musical before she\u2019d even opened the envelope. She joked, \u201cThank God I picked the right outfit. \u201d As the camera panned to show nominees for best director of a musical, it focused on the actor Christopher Fitzgerald, not Michael Arden, the director of \u201cSpring Awakening. \u201d Mr. Arden later tweeted: \u201cIf you know anything about me I\u2019ve spent the last 10 years of my life  \u2014   what some would consider the lifeblood of a woman\u2019s career  \u2014   just trying to have children.

From the show\u2019s opening number, in which Mr. Corden glanced back fondly on his formative years as a bespectacled kid with big dreams, parents were paid tribute throughout the night for the encouragement they offered and sacrifices they made for their   sons and daughters. In his acceptance speech, Mr. Diggs thanked his father for joining him in a preschool gymnastics performance in which they both wore \u201cmatching rainbow tights,\u201d and his mother for \u201cpermission to do something that everyone else wasn\u2019t doing. \u201d Later in the program, Mr. Corden found his father in the audience and asked him how he thought the show was going. \u201cIt\u2019s great, mate,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut it\u2019s going on a bit, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Compiled by Mike Hale, Scott Heller, Charles Isherwood, Dave Itzkoff and Erik Piepenburg.","14":"During a June 13 speech, presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he will be \u201cmeeting with the NRA\u201d to discuss how Americans can best defend themselves in the wake of the Orlando terror attack.

There was never a reason for them to be hopeful, or to expect anything good, because nothing good came. It wasn\u2019t a cheerful way to live, but at least they were prepared. And I wanted to be prepared for what is, still, inevitable: that people die, and that you will, at some point, be left to fend for yourself that no one is responsible for you, and people will fail you at every turn. Everyone becomes an orphan at some point. At least by reading, I could find a way to feel less alone in my fears. \u201d Hidden Figures and the Power of PragmatismThe Undefeated | Soraya Nadia McDonald\u201cBesides communicating about the power of common interests, Hidden Figures demonstrates why sneering dismissively at \u2018identity politics\u2019 or using the term as a pejorative amounts to little more than hogwash.

Nothing about this series of events is unexpected, interesting, or unique to her personality. The only glimmers of individuality to be found come during her first, truncated audition when Mia briefly wells up with sharp, devastated tears crying on cue is an actor staple, but the breadth of emotions we see flicker across Mia\u2019s face in the span of a few seconds is impressive, a testament to Stone\u2019s talent. \u201d Netflix\u2019s One Day at a Time Is Unpretentious, Artful, and a Pure DelightMatt Zoller Seitz | Vulture\u201cThe series still feels like comfort food. That\u2019s because the newness of Penelope and her world is nestled within the tradition of the          comedy, as well as within the more specific Norman Lear tradition of creating major characters that represent distinct political viewpoints without denying their humanity, then pitting them against each other in verbal combat without giving up on the idealistic notion that there\u2019s common ground to be found somewhere if you look hard enough. \u201d Kate Beckinsale Is a Legit Movie StarK. Austin Collins | The Ringer\u201cBeckinsale\u2019s best roles emphasize this lack of likability. Her peculiar talent is an uncanny ability to seem like she\u2019s all surface, no depth. At least, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen when certain directors let her take that idea and run with it. Hence the miracle of her collaboration with Stillman, whose The Last Days of Disco (1998) gave Beckinsale her first seriously great role, and whose more recent Love  Friendship is a comparably rich, virtuosic turn almost 20 years later. Beckinsale is a presence who seems most alive when a director doesn\u2019t take her intelligence for granted \u2014  which is rare. \u201d","16":" (CNN) Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein put out a very odd statement late Thursday night. He attacked anonymous sources and insisted that any story using them is rightly viewed extremely skeptically. I reached out to Jay Rosen, a professor of journalism at New York University and the author of Press Think, a blog about media and politics, for some perspective on the history of anonymous sourcing and what it means for the future of journalism. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: Rod Rosenstein urged \u201dcaution\u201d for people reading stories about the Trump White House that contain anonymous sourcing. Is that caution warranted? Why or why not? Rosen: Caution is always advisable toward stories based on anonymous sources. Yes. Even the people who produce these stories would probably agree with that. But if Rod Rosenstein wanted to warn us away from a report he knew to be misleading, his statement fails. It suffers from the same vagueness of origin that casts doubt on the statements of confidential sources.  Which revelations is Rosenstein talking about? What is the predicate for his actions in releasing this statement? What is that phrase, \u201dwhen they do not identify the country. ..\u201d doing in there? He seems to want to say more, but something prevents him. Or maybe he wanted to say less, but someone forced him. Either way, his statement is opaque. Which is the whole problem with confidential sources. They are opaque. Cillizza: Let\u2019s take a step back. What is the history of anonymous sources? Where did this all start? Rosen: I don\u2019t think we know for sure. One of the oldest dynamics in politics  \u2014   reaching back to the 18th century Parliaments  \u2014   is when the loser in an internal conflict decides to \u201dchange the game\u201d by going public with a dispute that had previously been kept in house. Since they still have to live in that house, these people tend to be anonymous. This method in political combat first became possible when there were printed journals reporting on Parliament, and coffee houses where public questions were being debated \u2014   assisted, of course, by the newspapers of the day, on sale in those establishments.  Roughly speaking, then, the origins of anonymous sourcing, the birth of public opinion as a live factor in politics, and the invention of political reporting all occur together, in the mid 1700s. And that dynamic I identified  \u2014   loser in an internal dispute goes public, hoping that the reaction will change the outcome  \u2014    continues unchanged to this day. Cillizza: Is anonymous sourcing on the rise?  Rosen: I would be cautious about any statement like that. That would take a massive content study to determine with any reliability. Such studies are done, but they tend to lag   years behind the fact.  One thing we can point to is the rise of publications  \u2014   Politico, Business Insider, Axios would be three  \u2014   that in my view simply don\u2019t care how often they have to rely on blind sources. They have made the call that getting the inside dope is more important to their readers than any fussy concerns about transparency. They have decided not to worry about it. In fact, Henry Blodget, founder of Business Insider, has said, \u201dWe will grant anonymity to any source at any time for any reason.\u201d Pretty clear statement. The existence of such competitors obviously has an effect on the climate as a whole.  Cillizza: President Obama\u2019s White House was notoriously hard on leakers. Trump seems to have taken that to a new level. Accurate reading? Rosen: It\u2019s well established that Obama was more aggressive against leakers than any previous president. Judging by his public statements, Trump is even more willing to go to war, but I don\u2019t think we know what is going on behind the scenes. The first criminal case against a leaker began this month. It\u2019s plausible to suspect that a lot is happening on this front, but we simply don\u2019t know enough to say for sure.  Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \u201dAnonymous sources are _________ in modern journalism.\u201d  Rosen: \u201dAnonymous sources are withdrawals against the bank balance built up by more transparent practices in modern journalism.\u201d News accounts that rely on confidential sources do not contain within themselves the information required for us to trust them. By definition we cannot \u201dgo to the source\u201d because the source is hidden. If we extend our trust to such reports, we do so because of reputation: the reporter\u2019s reputation, or more often the news brand\u2019s. Some acts of journalism are easier to trust than others. If I tell you what the data shows about test scores in different schools around your district, and I also link to the data so you can check for yourself, that is a fundamentally different act from. .. \u201dThe special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election is interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe that now includes an examination of whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice, officials said.\u201d (My italics.)  That term, \u201dofficials said\u201d is relatively hard to trust. We can\u2019t go to those people and ask: did you really say that? We can\u2019t decide how credible they are, and act accordingly. Instead we have to trust the Washington Post, which gave us this report, and its reporters. It might be rational to do so, but it\u2019s also subtractive. We are drawing on reserves of trust built up by previous acts of journalism that told us the Post could be trusted. Some acts of reporting add to the bank account, others draw upon reserves of trust. To put it another way, when trust is the currency, stories that depend on anonymous sources are expensive.","17":"  of the United States of America Donald J. Trump is serving as a     .

We had military people there we had drill sergeants and colonels and we actually had a general. I always respected those people and I learned that at a young age. They\u2019re terrific. \u201d Urban, whose work in Pennsylvania for Trump after joining his campaign when former Sen.

You just get the sense of born again patriotism. Yesterday, Mr. Trump was so   by the military that it really does signal a new beginning for our military forces and for our country. I think it\u2019s a reclamation of our patriotism and a belief in the foundation of our country \u2014  duty, honor, country. \u201d   Braithwaite, who joined the Naval Academy back toward the end of former President Jimmy Carter\u2019s administration, compared the energy for Trump in the Armed Forces community to that which Ronald Reagan saw as he was about to take office. \u201cI joined the Navy at the end of the Carter administration and the transformation when President Reagan came in was just unbelievable,\u201d Braithwaite said. \u201cIt was palpable. You could feel it, and it was overnight. I\u2019ll tell you, I feel the same way now, that this has been probably the first time in the last 20 some years when we felt this kind of support from the    and I think that was really kind of evident yesterday at the game. I think that people saw for the first time the kind of    that   Trump will be and it\u2019s, again, a kind of rebirth of patriotism across our country. \u201d Braithewaite believes that the troops see in Trump someone who believes in them. \u201cI think he believes in them,\u201d he said. \u201cAs part of the transformation team, I am hearing constantly from them that for the first time in a long time they feel like there\u2019s an emphasis on their service. Our military people are out there sacrificing each and every day personally and professionally. They feel this is a new dawn if you will in getting the kind of support from a    that will really help them in being the preeminent military service in the world and reclaiming the stature of America. It\u2019s pretty amazing, I will tell you, and it\u2019s a phenomenal opportunity to see the military recognized for what they\u2019re preparing to do \u2014  what they\u2019re preparing to sacrifice \u2014  on behalf of all of us to guarantee our freedom. That\u2019s huge. \u201d Swann, the former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver who went on to serve as former President George W. Bush\u2019s chair of the President\u2019s Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition, told Breitbart News that Trump\u2019s appearance at the   game was huge for the cadets and midshipmen and all those serving the country right now. \u201cI think it was very important to all of the branches of the service and especially to the cadets and midshipmen and young people serving in the military that can see a demonstration of support from the incoming president,\u201d Swann said in a phone interview. \u201cI think there was genuine excitement for   Trump being there, and I think throughout his campaign he has always supported the military and leading with the strength of the military. I don\u2019t think the   is ever going to allow his military to go without. Back when it comes to being supportive of the best equipment and the best training and thoughtfulness about how they\u2019re deployed and how they\u2019re used. But as you know, most people and most leadership throughout the military, while they serve, there\u2019s no political opinion \u2014  they serve the    and he\u2019s going to be the next   . \u201d Swann\u2019s son, who plays for Army, helped the team win its first game in the iconic annual rivalry in 15 years. \u201cThat\u2019s right \u2014  and a great moment for the Superintendent and the head coach, they\u2019ve been behind for a number of years and for all of these varsity players to get a gold star for the win over Navy on their letterman\u2019s jacket, that\u2019s huge,\u201d Swann said when asked about how it felt for Army to win. Looking forward, each of these guys and more that Breitbart News spoke with believes that it\u2019s morning in America again and Trump represents a fresh new style of leadership in the United States. When asked to compare his history as a winner with Trump\u2019s theme of winning, Swann noted that despite the intense   rivalry over the years, at the end of the day these guys are all on the same side against America\u2019s enemies on the world stage. \u201cI don\u2019t think the   has ever shied away from the fact that he\u2019s coming out on top, being the winner,\u201d Swann said. \u201cHe\u2019s based most of his personal career, and everything else he\u2019s done, on being a winner. When look at a rivalry team like Army and Navy, it\u2019s very competitive. It\u2019s a big rivalry game. It\u2019s about winning. But when you look at the Army and Navy, you want them both to win because eventually and essentially they are on the same team. \u201d Don\u2019t miss @FoxNewsSunday   #PEOTUS @realDonaldTrump  host Chris Wallace @   from Trump Tower, #TrumpForceOne\u2708\ufe0f the #ArmyNavy game. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) December 11, 2016,  Nicholson believes Trump\u2019s appearance at the game \u2014  the first ever by a   and the current outgoing President Barack Obama has only gone to one such game \u2014  was a huge morale booster for the military. \u201cI think it was a real morale boost for the military, which they need these days, and it was a sign they\u2019re going to have a real friend and supporter and morale encourager in this new    they\u2019re going to have in a few weeks,\u201d Nicholson said.

Reigning on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 singles chart at No. 1 is the   song \u201dDespacito (Remix),\u201d featuring Justin Bieber and Puerto   American singers Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee. Not since \u201dMacarena\u201d dominated the coveted slot in 1996 has a Spanish language song soared and reached such crossover acceptance. \u201dDespacito\u201d was already a   hit, but it was the remix with Bieber that hurled the song smack into the mainstream.   At a time when many US Latinos are feeling marginalized and under attack from political rhetoric on the right and ineffective representation on the left, Spanish pop songs that galvanize an American audience are a recognition that Latinos are part of the American landscape. In addition, a wellspring of Latino TV roles has begun to counter inflammatory images with contemporary Latino profiles.     After four seasons, Hulu\u2019s \u201dEast Los High\u201d is ending its run. The teen drama, set in a predominantly Latino high school, became a hit in Atlanta with   millennials before it became   TV in Los Angeles. Youth, regardless of race and ethnicity, responded to the series because of its authentic characters and relatable narratives.   When Carlos Portugal and Kathleen Bedoya created the show, they gave actors Danielle Vega and Vanessa Vasquez a platform from which to both receive a 2015 Daytime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Performer in a New Approaches Drama Series, while breakout performances led Gabriel Chavarria to key roles in \u201dLowriders\u201d and \u201dWar of the Planet of the Apes.\u201d Another actor from \u201dEast Los High,\u201d J. D. Pardo,  was cast in the principal role in FX\u2019s \u201dSons of Anarchy\u201d spinoff \u201dMayans MC.\u201d The writers\u2019 room for \u201dEast Los High\u201d included predominantly Latino and female writers, such as Evelina Fernandez, Charo Toledo, Luisa Leschin and Nancy De Los Santos. Just as Showtime\u2019s \u201dResurrection Blvd.\u201d did 17 years earlier, a multiyear,   show and cast yields experienced creators, writers, actors, producers and skilled tradecraft professionals. Shows like ABC\u2019s \u201dCristela\u201d and CW\u2019s \u201dJane the Virgin\u201d laid the foundation for a predominantly Latina cast to reboot Norman Lear\u2019s \u201dOne Day at a Time\u201d on Netflix.  America Ferrera\u2019s   comedic role in NBC\u2019s \u201dSuperstore\u201d expanded the comedic range for Latinas by providing the yang to Sofia Vergara\u2019s    ying in ABC\u2019s \u201dModern Family.\u201d   Latino acting leads have grown substantively in the area of scripted dramas. Wilmer Valderrama\u2019s standout performance as the   and cocky Nick Torres on the 14th season of CBS\u2019s \u201dNCIS\u201d  \u2014   the    US   television scripted series    reflects the cumulative advancement that Latinx actors have made on many   television shows across networks, cable and streaming services. Last week, actress Elena Verdugo passed away at age 92  Many remember Verdugo for her role, from 1969 to 1976, as Consuelo Lopez on ABC\u2019s \u201dMarcus Welby, M. D.\u201d It\u2019s hard to believe that, at the time, Elena\u2019s supporting role was the most visible and recognizable Latina character ever on seen American TV.  It would take 28 more years before another actress, Eva Longoria, would have that distinction, as Gabrielle Solis on ABC\u2019s \u201dDesperate Housewives\u201d    although actresses Sonia Manzano, Rita Moreno, Lynda Carter, Constance Marie and Jessica Alba also had prominent TV roles during that time.  Although the struggle to include more Latinx characters and story lines to television content has long been documented, the solution has always been to create programming that affords emerging talent an opportunity to build their craft, either behind or in front of the camera.   At times, that opportunity has been the strongest when members of two different marginalized groups work together. Under John Ridley\u2019s    a black screenwriter and film director    leadership and direction, ABC\u2019s \u201dAmerican Crime\u201d crafted complicated and multidimensionally inclusive characters. Benito Martinez\u2019s   performances in all three seasons    but, in particular, the most recent one    portrayed a Mexican   bilingual dad who crosses the border without authorization to retrace his missing son\u2019s path to the US Ridley tackled immigration by juxtaposing hate and humanity. \u201dAmerican Crime\u2019s\u201d final season accomplished what armies of political talk show pundits could not: It imagined immigration in an understandable and contextual media narrative. Like Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s film \u201dAmores Perros,\u201d \u201dAmerican Crime\u201d developed overlapping and intersecting hot button and taboo topics that contrasted American lives trying to survive an unforeseen event.

[Between Friday, August 5, and the following Friday, over 100 people were shot, with 99 of those occurring from Friday to the next Thursday. This brings the number of shootings to an incredible 800 more than this time last year, according to the Chicago Tribune.  The dangerous week included one of the most deadly days seen in Chicago in over a decade when Monday, August 8, groaned under the weight of 19 shootings and nine killed. One of the victims was a    boy shot outside his home in the Lawndale neighborhood. The child, Tavon Tanner, was sitting outside on the stoop of his home with his family when someone nearby opened fire. The family scrambled into the home, but the child was shot. He is in good condition in a local hospital. The deadly toll on Monday included an amazing nine dead in less than 24 hours. Due to the large number of deaths, Monday was Chicago\u2019s deadliest day in 13 years. On Thursday, another man was sitting inside his home when several stray bullets came ripping through his window, striking him in the neck and head. The    man died from his wounds. The wildly bloody week brings the number of shootings in the Windy City to 2, 584 shot and 396 shot and killed. According to one estimate, a person in Chicago is shot every 2 hours, and one is shot and killed every 12 hours. And all of this is ahead of what promises to be a steamy hot weekend likely to see up to 40 more shootings and perhaps as many as 10 more deaths.

Shannon Maureen Conley, 19, now prefers to go by Amatullah, she told CNN during a visit to her jailhouse the day before her sentencing. The name means female \u201dservant of Allah,\u201d she said. Conley initially took the name Halima after converting to Islam. She will become one of the first Americans sentenced for conspiracy to support ISIS. Conley attracted national attention last year after authorities arrested her at Denver International Airport. Investigators said she told them she was going to Turkey to await word from an ISIS member in Syria    a man she met on the Internet and planned to marry.  According to court documents, she intended to become a nurse in an ISIS camp. She is a Colorado certified nurse\u2019s aide. Here are three key questions about her case: 1. What does she say about her crime? Conley seemed friendly and nervous Thursday, sometimes hesitant to say anything that would upset her attorney, who wasn\u2019t present. She was happy to talk about   matters such as her new coiffure: a tight braid to her dark brown hair, arranged in four or five rows. She wasn\u2019t wearing a Muslim headscarf. \u201dOh, this is for tomorrow,\u201d Conley said about her new hairstyle for the sentencing in federal court. She declined to go into detail, however, about her pending punishment, in which she is facing a maximum of five years in prison and a $250, 000 fine. She pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist group. \u201dI\u2019m in a vulnerable place right now, and it would be stupid of me to talk to you when I\u2019m vulnerable,\u201d she told CNN during a video conference visit in the Jefferson County Detention Facility in Golden, which didn\u2019t allow any   taping. She didn\u2019t want to talk about her crime.  \u201dNo comment,\u201d she said. \u201dDidn\u2019t you learn your lesson last time?\u201d That was a reference to CNN\u2019s prior jailhouse visit, in which Conley said her attorney had advised her against talking to the media about her case. But Conley did acknowledge a measure of transformation since her arrest and jailing pending her sentence. That\u2019s why she changed her name, she said. \u201dI\u2019m a different person than when I came in,\u201d she explained. Opinion: When Americans leave for jihad, 2. What does her family say about her? Her mother, AnaMaria, was blunt. \u201dShe was clueless. She\u2019s just a teenager, young, with a big mouth,\u201d the mother told CNN last year. \u201dI think another time, another place, she would just be another kid with a big mouth.\u201d ISIS is extremely savvy with its Internet propaganda, and her daughter was a victim of the jihadist group, AnaMaria Conley said. The mother worries about other impressionable young Americans. \u201dI hope that justice rather than fear will prevail,\u201d the mother said.  She and her husband, John, were aware of their daughter\u2019s conversion to Islam but didn\u2019t know about her interest in extreme Islam or jihad. John Conley reportedly caught his daughter talking to her \u201dsuitor,\u201d a    Tunisian man, on Skype. The couple asked for the father\u2019s blessing, but he said no. On April 1, the father called the FBI to report that he had found her ticket for an April 8 flight to Turkey on his desk. Opinion: Rise of the female jihadists, 3. How much evidence do prosecutors have? The FBI and Joint Terrorism Task Force were tipped off to Conley\u2019s suspicious activity in November 2013, when the pastor and security director of Faith Bible Chapel told local police that Conley was wandering around campus and taking notes, court papers said. The church\u2019s main campus in Arvada was the scene of a gunman\u2019s fatal shooting in 2007. When church staff confronted Conley about her notes, she allegedly told them: \u201dWhy is the church worried about a terrorist attack?\u201d and that terrorists are \u201d. .. not allowed to kill aging adults and little children,\u201d according to court papers. Church officials asked her not to return. In an interview with the FBI the following month, she said she joined the U. S. Army Explorers to receive military training and intended to use the firearm skills to go overseas to wage jihad, court papers said. Over five months, authorities interviewed her seven times. Conley told them that \u201djihad must be waged to protect Muslim nations,\u201d court papers said. She preferred to wage jihad overseas, to be with jihad fighters.  Conley told investigators she \u201dwould be defending Muslims on the Muslim homeland against people who are trying to kill them,\u201d according to court documents. Conley told her parents that her knowledge of Islam was based solely on research she had conducted on the Internet. Four days before Conley\u2019s April 8 flight, federal investigators again questioned her about whether she would engage in actual combat on the ISIS battlefield. \u201dIf it was absolutely necessary, then yes. I wouldn\u2019t like it . .. but I would do it,\u201d she told authorities, according to court papers.

The crew members spent a short time in Japanese custody before being collected by a tanker to take them back to North Korea. The ship\u2019s crew members had evacuated and were on life boats when the Japanese Coast Guard reached them.  In the early hours of Thursday, the sinking ship began drifting closer to the Goto Islands, coming within 12 miles (20 kilometers) of the coast before it was completely submerged.

Which is why a female pilot from Delta Air Lines did something dramatic at a union meeting recently. Standing before her male colleagues, the captain unbuttoned her uniform, strapped a breast pump over the white undershirt she wore underneath, and began to demonstrate the apparatus. As the machine made its typical \u201cchug, chug, chug\u201d noise, attendees squirmed in their seats, looked at their feet and shuffled papers. It was the latest episode in what has proved to be a difficult workplace issue to solve: how to accommodate commercial airline pilots who are balancing new motherhood. It is a question that some employers have answered by creating leave policies or lactation rooms. But the flight deck of a jumbo jet isn\u2019t a typical workplace. Pilots are exempt from a provision in the Affordable Care Act requiring employers to accommodate new mothers. At 30, 000 feet, the issue touches not only on pilot privacy, but also aircraft safety. At Delta, a group of women pilots have banded together through a private Facebook page and have approached their union with formal proposals for paid maternity leave  \u2014     at the major airlines  \u2014   because they say they would like to stay home to   their babies. At Frontier Airlines, four female pilots are suing the company for discrimination, seeking the option of temporary assignments on the ground while pregnant or nursing. While their proposals differ, all say they aim for one thing: to avoid situations in which pilots have been leaving the cockpit in midflight for as long as 20 minutes, the amount of time often required to pump breast milk. \u201cThe airlines have maternity policies that are archaic,\u201d said Kathy McCullough, 61, a retired captain for Northwest Airlines, which merged with Delta in 2008, who has advocated on behalf of the pilots to Delta management. \u201cI am so glad that they\u2019re stepping forward and taking a stand. \u201d One reason for the lack of rules is that women make up only about 4 percent of the nation\u2019s 159, 000 certified airline pilots  \u2014   a number that has been slow to rise over the past decade or so. There were no female pilots at the biggest airlines until 1973, when American Airlines hired the first, Bonnie Tiburzi Caputo. In a reminder of how times have changed, that news was reported in The Los Angeles Times under the headline, \u201cAirline Pilot to Fly by Seat of Panties. \u201d \u201cAirline jobs were really reserved for men,\u201d said Captain Caputo, 67, who became something of a minor celebrity when American hired her. She has been retired from the airline for about 18 years. \u201cWhen we started, there were no maternity leaves, because there were no female pilots. \u201d More than 40 years later, the major carriers still haven\u2019t resolved this issue. They set their policies for pilots based on the collective bargaining agreements negotiated by the unions. But women of childbearing age account for just a sliver of union membership, so maternity leave and   policies have not been at the top of union agendas. Plus, some members oppose the proposals, citing the costs. One local union leader told several women in an email: \u201cHaving a child is a personal choice and asking the rest of us to fund your choice will be a difficult sell to the pilot group. \u201d The leader declined to be interviewed for this article the union said he was not an authorized spokesman. Delta\u2019s female pilots still hope to win over a majority of their colleagues. They argue that without paid leave, they\u2019re faced with a choice to either stay home to   their babies or earn income for their families. Female pilots can begin to lose wages months before a baby is born. Most contracts at major airlines force pregnant pilots to stop flying eight to 14 weeks before a baby\u2019s due date. After the push by Delta\u2019s pilots this summer, the airline changed its policy this month. Delta now allows them to fly, with their doctor\u2019s approval, until the end of pregnancy if they so choose. Morgan Durrant, a spokesman for Delta, pointed out that once they stop flying, women can use accrued sick days or apply for disability benefits to partially cover their lost wages. Otherwise, the leave is unpaid. Once a baby is born, the major airlines typically don\u2019t offer paid maternity leave or alternative ground assignments for   mothers. Some carriers, including United Airlines and Alaska Airlines, do offer female pilots up to one year of unpaid leave. Until recently, Delta did not offer such a policy, but the airline has added one year of unpaid leave to the pilot contract. Temporary ground assignments, which were proposed by the pilots at Frontier, could work as an alternative for some who live near company headquarters. But as many as one in five pilots resides at least 750 miles from work. Consider what it took for First Officer Brandy Beck, a    Frontier Airlines pilot, to pump breast milk. Once the plane was at cruising altitude and in autopilot mode, she would seek the agreement of her captain to take a break. In keeping with Frontier policy, the remaining pilot was required to put on an oxygen mask. Next a flight attendant  \u2014   to prevent passengers from approaching the lavatory  \u2014   would barricade the aisle with a beverage cart. Then the attendant would join the captain in the cockpit, in keeping with rules that require at least two people in an airline cockpit at all times. Only then could Ms. Beck slip into the lavatory for a   pumping session. \u201cIt\u2019s by far not my favorite place to make my child\u2019s next meal,\u201d Ms. Beck said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a sacrifice I knew I would have to accept because I came back to work. \u201d Ms. Beck said that after nearly 20 years in the aviation industry, she assumed she could keep her job and nurse her baby. \u201cI guess it never came to light in my mind that I couldn\u2019t do both,\u201d she said. Frontier\u2019s management has argued that extended breaks from the cockpit raise safety issues. The company has not offered an   alternative for breast pumping, however, or made available temporary jobs on the ground. \u201cWhile there are many workplaces that might allow for nursing mothers to express breast milk during a break from work activities, the duties of a commercial airline pilot present unique circumstances,\u201d a Frontier spokesman, Jim Faulkner, said in a statement. The Federal Aviation Administration has issued no official rules for pilots who pump  . But Alison Duquette, a spokeswoman for the agency, said that \u201cleaving the flight deck for 20 minutes would not be acceptable\u201d under most circumstances. A lactating mother often needs to pump breast milk every three to four hours. When she cannot do so, painful pressure can build up in her chest, accompanied by a risk of infection. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly distracting and painful,\u201d said Ms. Beck, \u201clike when you need to go to the bathroom and can\u2019t. \u201d In a few instances at Delta, according to several of the airline\u2019s women pilots, their colleagues had to pump breast milk in the cockpit. The pumps need electricity, and in some older planes, the only plugs available are on the flight deck. The Delta female pilots are seeking a leave policy that would let mothers stay home for six months with pay to   newborns, and up to two years of unpaid leave. Pilots can earn a base salary of $200, 000 and more in later years. But young pilots often start at low wages as flight instructors, crop dusters, or flying charter or tourism flights, and don\u2019t reach the major carriers until their early 30s, a time when they may be planning families. As a result, one Delta pilot said, it is not uncommon for several women in a class of new pilots to be pregnant after a standard yearlong period of probation flying. Ten female Delta pilots agreed to speak to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity, for fear of alienating their employer or the male union members they hope will take up their cause. The union, through a spokeswoman, Kelly Regus, declined to comment on \u201cthe substance of internal union discussions. \u201d Mr. Durrant, the Delta spokesman, noted that the airline had updated some of its policies, and he said it would continue to examine its maternity and paternity leave programs. \u201cBalancing the demands of a career and raising a family present challenges for all working parents, but we recognize there are unique challenges presented for our female pilots as their children are born,\u201d Mr. Durrant said in an emailed statement. It has been difficult for the women to compare notes about workplace issues. There are so few of them, they rarely see or fly with one another. That changed with a private Facebook group known as FAST  \u2014   Female Aviators Sticking Together  \u2014   that has grown quickly over the past year. It now has nearly 6, 000 members. There are also spinoffs like DAMP, or Delta Air Lines Mommy Pilots. The woman who delivered the breast pump demonstration in June did so on behalf of about 100 pilots in that Facebook group. And the Delta and Frontier pilots know they are pressing an issue that still plagues a group long dominated by women: flight attendants. This year, a flight attendant for Endeavor Air, a regional airline owned by Delta, filed a discrimination complaint with the New York City Commission on Human Rights, claiming the airline failed to provide reasonable breaks or private places to pump breast milk in her workplace. The commission is investigating. Mr. Durrant, the Delta spokesman, said Endeavor had worked to accommodate the employee and \u201chas gone to great lengths to provide reasonable accommodations for   employees. \u201d Joanna L. Grossman, an expert on labor law and gender issues, said the pilots are fighting a complex battle. \u201cThis is part of breaking down the cockpit door  \u2014   that\u2019s the glass ceiling here,\u201d said Ms. Grossman, a professor at the Dedman School of Law at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. \u201cHow do you make a job work when it was designed without you in mind?\u201d","26":"The Times of Israel reports:  US   Donald Trump told the Israel Hayom   daily that he intends to go through with his pledge to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem, saying that \u201cclearly I did not forget\u201d the promise made on the campaign trail.

[He criticized Congress for not expanding background checks to cover all guns sales in the wake of the Pulse Orlando shooting, although the Orlando attacker had passed a background check for both of his firearms and passed a   waiting period for his handgun as well.  And according to the East Bay Times, Kerr was also critical of Congress for not banning the sale of \u201cautomatic weapons,\u201d although the Orlando attacker did not use \u201cautomatic weapons. \u201d Kerr said, \u201cLet\u2019s have some checks. It\u2019s easier to get a gun than it is a driver\u2019s license. \u201d He said these things while sitting in Oakland, California, perhaps unaware that California not only has universal background checks  \u2014   the very kind of checks he is proposing  \u2014   but also a   waiting period on gun purchases, gun registration requirements, and gun confiscation laws.

From crumbling buildings to abandoned lots long overgrown by nature, Traub says he examined neighborhoods long troubled by destitution yet ripe with beauty and possibility. \u201dI want to show the complexity of the place. . .. It has a lot of hidden richness that maybe has been overlooked,\u201d Traub said. For example? Start with the ubiquitous churches, some recently converted from commercial buildings. Others, as he writes in the book\u2019s essay, were \u201dbuilt in more prosperous times, such as the Church of the Advocate, which played an important role in the Civil Rights era.\u201d \u201dI was most drawn to those that were smaller and in flux, changing denominations and pastors frequently. They seemed more like local businesses vying to attract congregations,\u201d he writes. He explored the area from 2008 to 2013, mostly in the first two years when he lived on the edge of North Philadelphia upon his return from China. A   camera    hood over head, with a tripod    was his tool of choice.  \u201dPeople thought I was a surveyor or real estate developer,\u201d Traub said, and asked what he was up to. \u201dBut for the most part, when I told them what I was doing, they were quite open and welcoming    happy that someone was taking interest in the neighborhood.\u201d Traub\u2019s choice of subjects reflected his personal experience in the area. North Philadelphia has both significant   and Hispanic populations, but Traub    of   and Chinese heritage    focused on black residents and neighborhoods. It was in those neighborhoods that his mother, a   started a renewal project that would transform vacant lots into a series of art parks. He helped in the summer and grew close to those he worked with. His mother\u2019s roots also drew him to China in the late 1990s. Wanting to explore his Asian heritage, he worked on a photo project examining people who migrated from the countryside to look for opportunity in cities like Beijing. It was a study in contradictions    cities were newly prosperous, yet the workers remained poor, living on the margins. Traub returned to the United States thinking he\u2019d explore economic divides there. That\u2019s not exactly how it turned out, he says. He went to Baltimore and cities in Ohio and elsewhere in the Rust Belt. Something didn\u2019t click. He turned to North Philadelphia. Once there, his interests were less about making a social point. \u201dWhile I was interested in economic differences and racial divides, I felt there was something more personal for me in the project,\u201d he said. \u201dI realized I had some kind of a specific connection in North Philadelphia. I was interested in looking at the place itself, not looking at it as a way to explore broader social issues.\u201d It was a return to a place that grabbed his imagination years ago. \u201dOn one hand it is ignored and in decline, but it also is a place of tremendous possibility and great human resources    people who are marginalized but also have a tremendous amount to offer,\u201d he said.

Think Airbnb meets Hotel   Tonight. Overnight\u2019s rentals were cheap  \u2014   private rooms were   going for $70 or $80 and entire homes were available for $150  \u2014     and users could find accommodations in 10 minutes or   less.  \u201d \u201d   But something even more important happened that week, something   that founder and CEO Asher Hunt is incredibly proud of. Hunt   said he received an email during the festival from someone   who had booked their stay on Overnight and had a great   experience. Here\u2019s how Hunt tells it: \u201d \u2019  \u2019 \u2019  \u2019 \u2019  \u2019 \u2019   Overnight also aims to be a   community of       users, Hunt said. \u2019 \u2019   \u2019 \u2019  \u2019 \u2019   After its success in Austin, Overnight launched in San Francisco   and, now, New York City. The app made its NYC debut on Thursday,   and the company says it already has 400 hosts on the app in New   York (and has 3, 500 nationwide). The company also launched a new   version of the app, which allows for faster, more simplified   booking than the previous version, and also allows users to book   multiple nights with the same host, which was not a feature   before now. \u2019 \u201d   Here\u2019s how it works: \u201d \u201d   Even before Overnight\u2019s official launch in New York, hosts were   already using the platform  \u2014   Hunt himself stayed with an   Overnight host on his most recent trip to New York.  \u201d \u2019   \u201dWe\u2019ve seen organic growth in Williamsburg and Brooklyn and we   see demand in the core of the city,\u201d Hunt said. \u201dThis is the   most practical step to prepare us to go international, which is   going to happen, conservatively, in the next six months to a   year.\u201d \u2019 \u201d   The obvious question about Overnight is how it\u2019s different from   Airbnb or from Hotel Tonight, and Hunt doesn\u2019t shy away from the   comparison to Overnight\u2019s   predecessor. For   Hunt, the structure of Airbnb was too rigid for him as a host and   the   booking didn\u2019t quite work for him as a guest.

It\u2019s President Barack Obama\u2019s story, but also Alexander Hamilton\u2019s, whose biography has been translated into an audacious musical heralded as a turning point for American theater. Obama attended a matinee performance in New York on Saturday with his daughters.   Already viewed by the likes of Hillary Clinton, Dick Cheney, and first lady Michelle Obama, \u201dHamilton\u201d is unorthodox in its telling of Alexander Hamilton\u2019s life. The mostly   and Latino actors    including creator and title star   Miranda, born to Puerto Rican immigrants    look nothing like traditional depictions of the white men who founded the country. So, too, does the show\u2019s   score reflect a contemporary sound more akin to Outkast than Oscar Hammerstein    perhaps a reason why Obama, who tweeted this month his favorite song of the moment was Outkast\u2019s \u201dLiberation,\u201d chose to see it. Tickets to \u201dHamilton\u201d have been hard to come by after critics swooned during an   run. Celebrities and New York tastemakers packed the Public Theater in the East Village nightly before the show moved to Broadway this month. It\u2019s already sold more than 200, 000 tickets for an   run at the Richard Rogers Theater.  The musical has attracted a stream of political heavyweights, eager to see a predecessor portrayed on stage. The first lady saw it back in April. Another U. S. President, Bill Clinton, attended a performance in March with wife Hillary, now the Democratic presidential frontrunner, and their daughter Chelsea. After Cheney, the former vice president, and his wife Lynne attended, the musical\u2019s creator couldn\u2019t help drawing the obvious comparison between the Republican and a character in his show, former vice president Aaron Burr, who famously shot and fatally wounded Hamilton in a duel. \u201dDick Cheney attended the show tonight,\u201d Miranda wrote. \u201dHe\u2019s the OTHER   who shot a friend while in office.\u201d For Obama, the parallels are more apparent to Hamilton\u2019s early life, before he entered public life. Hamilton was born out of wedlock on Nevis, in the Caribbean his father abandoned his family when Hamilton was young. Obama was also born on an island, Hawaii\u2019s Oahu, and his parents separated soon after he was born. His father moved away and the future president met him again only once, when he was 10 years old. RELATED: Meet the woman behind the woman on the $10 bill, Both spent chunks of their childhoods outside of the United States Hamilton on various islands in the West Indies, and Obama in Indonesia, where his mother worked as an anthropologist. The two even graduated from the same college: in the 1770s it was called King\u2019s College, now it\u2019s Columbia University in New York. Hamilton was the youngest of the Founding Fathers and became the country\u2019s first Treasury Secretary in his early thirties. Obama was also young for his job    at 47, he was the fifth youngest man to be elected president. But those biographical analogues aren\u2019t stopping Obama from moving to diminish Hamilton\u2019s most prominent memorial: his face on the $10 bill. The administration announced earlier this summer it would put a woman on a new version of the sawbuck, though they haven\u2019t chosen who she\u2019ll be. The Treasury Department says Hamilton will still have a place on the note, either on a separate version of the bill or in a smaller portrait on the back. Backlash against the decision to bump Hamilton was swift Ben Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, said he was \u201dappalled.\u201d The decision seemed doubly offensive since the face on the $20 note, President Andrew Jackson, is remembered mostly for his forced displacement of Native Americans and for killing another man in a duel. Hamilton, mused some of his fans, was being demoted, perhaps for his status as the most influential founder never to be president. The White House says Obama bears no ill will toward Hamilton.  Miranda\u2019s unorthodox telling of an 18th century life seemed to entertain Obama when he watched the show\u2019s creator perform an early version of the score at a 2009 White House poetry slam. \u201dTen dollar Founding Father without a father got a lot farther by working a lot harder, by being a lot smarter, by being a \u201d Miranda rapped in the East Room, drawing an amused smile from the President. After Miranda, who was singing as Hamilton\u2019s killer Aaron Burr, completed his final line    \u201dI\u2019m the damn genius that shot him!\u201d    Obama was the first to jump up for a standing ovation.","32":" (CNN) It\u2019s been a busy year for the US Border Patrol, with total nationwide arrests up 23% from 2015, according to a   report issued Friday by the Department of Homeland Security. DHS released its annual report on immigration enforcement efforts across various federal agencies, highlighting the prioritization of resources on convicted criminals, threats to national security and those who attempt to cross the border unlawfully. US Border Patrol reported 415, 816 apprehensions nationwide, compared to 337, 177 in fiscal year 2015. This increase in arrests, however, represents only a \u201dfraction\u201d of the apprehensions averaged per year between 1980 and 2008, according to the report. \u201dApprehensions on the border in recent years    a strong indicator of total attempts to cross the border    are much lower than they used to be,\u201d said DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson in a written statement following the report\u2019s release. But raw numbers alone do not tell the entire story. For instance, DHS emphasized the significant demographic changes of those crossing the southern border over the last 15 years. In 2006, the majority of individuals caught crossing the border without authorization were single adults from Mexico, whereas in 2016, the majority were families and unaccompanied children from Central America, according to DHS officials. The report also noted that an increasing share of migrants are surrendering to law enforcement to seek asylum protection rather than trying to evade apprehension.","33":"Hillary Clinton longs for the days when Americans knew how to execute a covert action abroad and not spill the details to reporters. Addressing a Goldman Sachs event in 2013, in one of the speeches that WikiLeaks published on Saturday, Mrs. Clinton gave a   realpolitik answer to the question of how to handle a problem like Syria. If the best chance of success was to act secretly inside that country, she made clear, she had no problem doing that. She went on to say  \u2014   as her audience already knew because of revelations in the news media  \u2014   that as secretary of state she had advocated secretly arming the Syrian opposition and moving forcefully to counter the Russians, who at that point were supporting President Bashar   but had not yet fully entered the conflict. \u201cMy view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene,\u201d she said in answer to a question from Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, which paid Mrs. Clinton about $225, 000 a speech to give what felt like an insider\u2019s view of the making of American foreign policy, months after she left office. But she quickly acknowledged that \u201cwe used to be much better at this than we are now. \u201d \u201cNow, you know, everybody can\u2019t help themselves,\u201d she added, and officials go out to \u201ctell their friendly reporters and somebody else: \u2018Look what we\u2019re doing, and I want credit for it. \u2019\u201d The three hacked speeches from 2013 that WikiLeaks published, most likely with Russian government assistance, help explain how Mrs. Clinton approaches some of the world\u2019s knottiest problems. They are a reminder of the   way she often assesses her most vexing opponents when the television cameras are not on. By the time she left office that year, she had met and assessed two of the three world leaders who were determined most prominently to challenge the United States: President Xi Jinping of China, whom she clearly admires President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whom she clearly detests (and who has returned the sentiment this election) and Kim   of North Korea, whose determination to build a nuclear weapon and missiles that could \u201creach Hawaii and the West Coast, theoretically\u201d poses a risk \u201cwe cannot abide,\u201d she said. At moments in the speeches, Mrs. Clinton was cleareyed about how difficult it would be to execute some of the actions she advocated, including a   zone over parts of Syria. \u201cTo have a   zone, you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas,\u201d she said. \u201cSo our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so we\u2019re not putting our pilots at risk  \u2014   you\u2019re going to kill a lot of Syrians. So all of a sudden this intervention that people talk about so glibly becomes an American and NATO involvement where you take a lot of civilians. \u201d Her assessment of the risk came before she was formally running for president. But two years later, in a television interview in October 2015, she sounded willing to take that risk. \u201cI personally would be advocating now for a   zone and humanitarian corridors to stop the carnage on the ground and from the air, to try to provide some way to take stock of what\u2019s happening, to try to stem the flow of refugees,\u201d she said. Her successor as secretary of state, John Kerry, tried last month to open those humanitarian corridors, but the effort collapsed in a dispute with Russia. A push to get it restarted during a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Saturday between Mr. Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, also failed. In the talks at Goldman Sachs, Mrs. Clinton was often more analytic than prescriptive, describing her perceptions of individual leaders and the domestic politics and foreign threats they face. In that regard, her approach is quite different from that of Donald J. Trump. In two interviews on foreign policy with The New York Times, one in March and another in July, Mr. Trump moved directly to his plans of action: bombing the Islamic State and taking oil, for example, or withdrawing troops from Europe and Asia if allies do not pay their share. While Mr. Trump often talks in terms of striking deals, Mrs. Clinton talks in the more traditional terms of  . When she became secretary in 2009, she posed a question about China to an Australian leader: \u201cHow do you deal toughly with your banker?\u201d In the Goldman transcript, she suggested that she had answered her own question when sparring with the Chinese over its claims in the South China Sea. \u201cI made the point at one point in the argument that, you know, you can call it whatever you want to call it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a claim to all of it. I said, by that argument, you know, the United States should claim all of the Pacific. We liberated it, we defended it. We have as much claim to all of the Pacific. And we could call it the American Sea, and it could go from the West Coast of California all the way to the Philippines. \u201d \u201cAnd, you know, my counterpart sat up very straight and goes, \u2018Well, you can\u2019t do that. \u2019\u201d Mrs. Clinton segued into an evaluation of Mr. Xi, the Chinese leader, who she noted had consolidated power in a way his predecessor never did, but had quickly traveled to places like Russia and Africa to assuage \u201cdoubts about Chinese practices. \u201d \u201cSo he\u2019s someone who you at least have the impression is a more worldly, somewhat more experienced politician,\u201d she said. Mr. Xi has since become more aggressive in the South China Sea, and it is unclear how forcefully Mrs. Clinton, if she became president, would confront him over his claims. She acknowledged at one point that the administration had gotten distracted from its \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia. In North Korea, the situation has worsened much more drastically. She summarized the Chinese message to the North Koreans this way: \u201cWe don\u2019t care if you occasionally shoot off a missile. That\u2019s good. That upsets the Americans and causes them heartburn, but you can\u2019t keep going down a path that is unpredictable. \u201d That, of course, is exactly the path they have gone down.","34":"During his   career, Harry Belafonte has been a singer, an actor, a friend to Martin Luther King Jr. a Unicef   ambassador, an   activist and more. \u201cI\u2019m at a time of life when I\u2019m examining the entire journey,\u201d he said one recent afternoon at his Manhattan home, lamenting how the dreams of the civil rights movement are far from realized. \u201cWhen I was 20 and 30, my visions for what the world would be, all things were possible. \u201d Mr. Belafonte, for whom art and activism have been inextricably linked, said his life is a \u201ccall and response,\u201d and, at 89, he isn\u2019t ready to retire from being one of society\u2019s most passionate and visible advocates just yet. This weekend, \u201cMany Rivers to Cross,\u201d a   \u201cmusic, art and justice\u201d festival in the Atlanta area focuses on three issues: voting, mass incarceration, and the relationship between community and law enforcement.

The event will raise money for Sankofa. org, a social justice organization founded by Mr. Belafonte that unites   organizations and artists in the fight against problems like income disparity and inequities in the justice system. \u201cWhat makes a movement work are thousands of parts that come together and express itself in favor of a given destination or objective,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to find men and women who are willing to play the role that each of these things demand. \u201d With Election Day nearing in what has been a contentious presidential race exposing deep ideological divides, registration services will be available to help attendees ahead of nationwide deadlines. \u201cThe vote is perhaps the single most important weapon in our arsenal,\u201d Mr. Belafonte said. An area called the social justice village will feature representatives from over 40 organizations. The goal is to allow festivalgoers to \u201cwalk away with tools to better go out and support the causes they care about,\u201d said Gina Belafonte, who helped organize the event with her father. Mr. Belafonte said, \u201cWhen Trayvon Martin was shot and our community went into a response to that, there was no question in my mind that America was being awakened to its reality. \u201d Thinking back to the 1950s and \u201960s, when he toiled alongside activists including Dr. King, Julian Bond and Fannie Lou Hamer, Mr. Belafonte recalled how Dr. King represented a \u201charvest of opportunity. \u201d He added: \u201cThe energy that went into the movement disappeared because people were reaping the benefits. We\u2019ve forgotten what the opportunity was about. \u201d In 2012, a brouhaha ensued after Mr. Belafonte asserted that today\u2019s celebrities have \u201cturned their back on social responsibility\u201d and mentioned Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9. Jay Z responded in an interview with Rap Radar\u2019s Elliott Wilson by saying among other things, \u201cmy presence is charity. \u201d Mr. Belafonte said that he extended an olive branch and that he and Jay Z met one on one. But Mr. Belafonte fervently maintains that artists must do more to champion causes. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that artists are of the same passion and of the same kind of commitment of the artists of my time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe absence of black artists is felt very strongly because the most visible oppression is in the black community. \u201d Mr. Belafonte provides counsel to celebrities and organizations, saying that he draws parallels between the roadblocks and successes of the \u201950s and \u201960s and those of the present political movements. Linda Sarsour, the executive director of the Arab American Association of New York, said conversations with Mr. Belafonte had proved critical. \u201cMr. B plays no games with us,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen he doesn\u2019t think we\u2019re doing the right thing, he tells us. He said, \u2018Look, you need the wisdom of your elders, but we need your energy right now. \u2019\u201d T.

In the widely viewed video for the song \u201cWarzone,\u201d which he plans to perform at the festival, he spotlights the cases of Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and Philando Castile. \u201cIt was very insightful to hear from someone who had been through so much and been a part of history in so many ways,\u201d he said of his meeting with Mr. Belafonte. With his 90th birthday on his mind, Mr. Belafonte paused to take stock. \u201cI wake up at the age of 90, and I look around and say, \u2018What do we need now? \u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWell, the same things needed now are the same things needed before,\u201d he went on. \u201cMovements don\u2019t die because struggle doesn\u2019t die. \u201d","35":"New Delhi (CNN) Violence has spread across the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, after police opened fire on crowds of protestors Tuesday killing five.  Over 1, 000 paramilitary troops have been sent to the state in a bid to quell the unrest, which has seen buses torched and buildings set ablaze. The outbreak of discontent began over a week ago in the district of Mandsaur, as farmers    frustrated with the state\u2019s current agricultural policies    took to the streets to demand higher crop prices and a waiver on existing bank loans.  The   state is one of several in India to have suffered from    crop failures in recent years. Police had initially denied responsibility for the deaths of the protestors, blaming it instead on \u201d  elements\u201d and crowd violence.   But on Thursday the state\u2019s Home Minister Bhupendra Singh backed away from the claims, announcing that it had become \u201dclear from the investigation that the five people died from police bullets.\u201d Curfew, suspended internet  The intensity and size of the protests appeared to have caught Indian authorities off guard.  A    curfew has since been enforced in Mandsaur. Internet services have also been suspended in multiple districts, according to police reports. Protest leaders, however, have denied accusations of violence. \u201dThe farmers did not come to the protest with any petrol or anything that can be used to start a fire,\u201d said Sunil Gaur, a spokesperson for the National Farmers Labor Union, one of the groups behind the protest.  In light of the deaths, the state\u2019s Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan took to Twitter to issue an emotional plea to farmers to end the violence.  \u201dI appeal to my fellow brothers to maintain peace. I am deeply pained by the turn of events today. I stand by families in this hour of grief.\u201d   \u2019A people\u2019s movement\u2019 Madhya Pradesh, which is ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)  is considered part of India\u2019s farming heartland, owing to its large agricultural output.  Farmers in the state have long demanded a   minimum fixed price for their produce to help protect against fluctuations in crop prices.  According to a 2006 report, later endorsed by the BJP party in its 2014 general election manifesto, but yet to be implemented, all crop prices should be fixed at a minimum of 50 per cent higher than the production costs. Protestors felt betrayed by the government\u2019s failure to   on their pledge, said Gaur. \u201dThe demands we have are not for the state government, it is for the central government,\u201d he added. \u201dNow this movement will go from Madhya Pradesh and spread across the whole country, this will become a people\u2019s movement.\u201d  Almost 70% of India\u2019s population of 1. 3 billion live in rural areas, according to India\u2019s census, but agriculture accounts for just 15 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. Last year, Modi promised to boost the country\u2019s agriculture sector with a target of doubling the income of farmers by 2022.","36":"(Reuters)  \u2014   Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who is pushing for executive powers, cites Hitler\u2019s Germany as an example of an effective presidential system, in comments broadcast by Turkish media on Friday.

S. military officials say Islamic State foreign fighters are losing morale and making excuses not to fight, and a recent stash of records left behind by its fighters in Mosul appears to confirm that. [One Belgian militant had a medical note saying he had \u201cback pain\u201d and would not join the battle, according to the documents reported by the Washington Post.  Another foreign fighter from Kosovo said he had \u201chead pain. \u201d He and another Kosovar asked to move to Syria. Another from France said he wanted to leave Iraq to carry out a suicide attack at home, several requested transfers to Syria, and some just refused to fight. The stashes were found by Iraqi forces after they took over an ISIS base in Mosul, the terrorists\u2019 embattled stronghold in Iraq. \u201cThere are fighters who don\u2019t want to fight or who are making excuses and want to leave the country, [the records] are indicators that are useful to us and they provide some insight into the state of the enemy,\u201d the spokesman for the U. S.  coalition Air Force Col. John Dorrian told reporters at the Pentagon on Wednesday. Since October, Iraqi forces supported by a U. S.  coalition have begun pushing ISIS out of Mosul, and U. S. officials say its members still left in Western Mosul now face two choices. \u201cThey\u2019re either going to surrender or they\u2019re going to be annihilated,\u201d Dorrian said. \u201cThey are on the back foot. Their fighters are being killed very quickly in some cases. And they are completely isolated in west Mosul, and they\u2019re awaiting their fate there,\u201d he said. As recently as last year, ISIS was still attracting about 2, 000 foreign fighters per month to Iraq and Syria, but now the numbers are down to between 100 to 200, Dorrian said. The records have also prompted concerns that some fighters are indeed making their way back home. Of more than 4, 000 foreign fighters who have left the European Union nations, about one third have returned home, according to a report by the International Centre for Counterterrorism. Dorrian acknowledged that there are \u201csmall numbers\u201d of ISIS fighters getting out of Iraq and Syria. \u201cIt\u2019s small numbers. They\u2019re not  \u2014   not really in any position to be leaving because, in many areas, they\u2019re isolated,\u201d he said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to fight, wants to return to France,\u201d said the records on one    French resident of Algerian descent. \u201cClaims his will is a martyrdom operation in France. Claims sick but doesn\u2019t have a medical report. \u201d At one ISIS base, five out of 14 records belonged to French citizens. At another, 16 Russian and four French passports were found. There were also 20 blank Iraqi passports, suggesting that militants were forging them to leave the country. More foreign fighters have come from France than any other country in Europe since 2011, when the Syrian civil war began, fueling the rise of ISIS. The French government said 700 of its citizens joining ISIS remain in Iraq and Syria, including 275 women and 17 minors, according to the Post. Terrorism expert Aymenn   told the paper, \u201cThere are plenty of foreign fighters that went and found that the ISIS experience wasn\u2019t what they thought it would be. \u201d \u201cThey thought it would be a great adventure,\u201d he said.","38":"Asked for his opinion of Breitbart News, acclaimed journalist Glenn Greenwald praised the news site\u2019s editorial integrity and said the site was \u201cvery impressive in terms of the impact they\u2019ve been able to have. \u201d[While Greenwald was clear that Breitbart contains content he \u201csometimes find repellant\u201d and Breitbart writers and articles he\u2019s highly critical of \u201cjust on political grounds,\u201d he gave Breitbart News high marks for \u201cgiving voice to people who are otherwise excluded. \u201d  Although he prefers to avoid political labels for himself, Greenwald is a former columnist for   media outlets Salon and the Guardian and one of the founding editors of new media news source The Intercept, a   site that has shown political independence by publishing articles blasting both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton: Greenwald spoke to this reporter about the Making the News podcast. About his opinion of Breitbart News and the state of   media, he said: I think Breitbart is actually a fascinating case. And I do think   media has had a lot more success in pioneering ways to challenge establishment authority that   media has. I think very much the same spirit that animates Breitbart was also the animating force behind Matt Drudge and, to a lesser extent, Rush Limbaugh  \u2014   none of which have ever been part of or comfortable within the Republican establishment. In fact, all of them, in varying degrees, has been very antagonistic to the Republican establishment. Certainly Drudge has and definitely Breitbart has, maybe not Rush Limbaugh quite as much, but to some degree, too. So there\u2019s obviously a lot of things at Breitbart that are published that I vehemently disagree with and sometimes find repellant just on an ideological basis. But what I find really interesting about Breitbart is that it captured the ethos of a significant part of the conservative movement and the   electorate, and even independents that have been completely excluded from all of the organs of establishment thought in the Republican party. And not only did that, but it was so independent in how it did it. You know, it was extremely critical of Republican party leaders, and even today  \u2014   I mean, obviously, I think it\u2019s fair to say Breitbart has been partial to Trump, but one of the things that has actually impressed me is that even in this transition, when Trump nominates someone who\u2019s record is at odds with the promises that Trump made that appealed to Breitbart\u2019s writers and readers, Breitbart has been very vocal in being very critical, even of the candidate with whom they\u2019re most closely associated with, which is Trump  \u2014   which is integrity and a sort of editorial independence that I think most media outlets on both the left and the establishment right utterly lack. And so there\u2019s a lot of bad things I have to say about Breitbart articles and Breitbart writers, just on political grounds, but in terms of how they\u2019re using their platform, and how they\u2019re amplifying and channeling this independence and giving voice to people who are otherwise excluded, I think it\u2019s all very impressive in terms of the impact they\u2019ve been able to have.

S. ally where chronic instability allows the deadliest surviving al Qaeda franchise to flourish.   rebels of the Shiite Houthi sect sparked alarm in Washington after seizing a presidential palace in the volatile   nation, in what officials called a coup. There are now signs that the rebels    which have been resistant to American   efforts despite a common antipathy to al Qaeda     and the U. S.  government of President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi have agreed a deal to end the crisis.  READ: Yemen takeover threatens downward sectarian spiral, But the situation remains volatile and a reminder of how the intricate, shifting and treacherous tribal and sectarian divides of the Middle East often confound U. S. efforts to frame coherent   policy. Obama has spent much of his administration sponsoring a political transition designed to restore stability in Yemen and to cap the sectarianism that sustains al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Washington has offered   training to the government in the Yemeni capital Sanaa and has also mounted a campaign of drone strikes against key AQAP leaders. The group is regarded by U. S. officials as the most potent offspring of Osama bin Laden\u2019s jihadist movement and has claimed responsibility for the attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo this month. AQAP also almost succeeded in bringing down a United States commercial jet over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009, and has tried to attack the U. S. mainland on at least two other occasions. The group\u2019s potential was underlined in a video released on Wednesday in which a senior leader of AQAP in Yemen, Nasser bin Ali   said it was better for jihadists to wage war in their home nations, rather than fighting on the front lines in Syria.   The message will alarm Western governments fearful that Muslim extremists radicalized at home or who have fought in Syria, Iraq or Yemen are plotting new attacks in the wake of the Paris carnage. RELATED: Yemeni government, rebels reach tentative agreement, source says, CNN\u2019s Brian Todd reported that meanwhile, ISIS    al Qaeda\u2019s jihadist rival    was now also beginning to establish a presence in the country. Yemen, which borders the Red Sea and the strategically important Gulf of Aden    a major oil transit route    sits next to key U. S. allies, Saudi Arabia and Oman.  But it is also important rhetorically for the Obama administration. In a speech in September on combating ISIS, Obama held up U. S. operations in Yemen as an example for a new   doctrine which does not rely on sending troops into dangerous foreign quagmires. \u201dThis strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years,\u201d Obama said. Obama vowed to use \u201dforce against anyone who threatens America\u2019s core interests, but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order.\u201d The obvious problem with that strategy is that it needs secure, powerful local partners to have a hope of working.  In failed states like Syria and Yemen, those partners often do not exist, or are, like Hadi, are deeply vulnerable. Stephen Seche, a former career foreign service officer, who served as U. S. Ambassador to Yemen between 2007 and 2010, said the current situation was bad news for the White House. \u201dThe Hadi government has been a good partner of ours in the   arena,\u201d he said. \u201dIf you move President Hadi from the equation, then I think all bets are off in many respects.\u201d After fighting raged in the streets of Sanaa, and a U. S. diplomatic vehicle was caught in the crossfire, the Pentagon moved two ships within range of the country in case the State Department gives the order for an evacuation of the embassy. With memories of the raid by extremists on U. S. compounds in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012, which killed four Americans still haunting the administration, and fears of a hostage drama, no one wants to take chances. SEE ALSO: ISIS gaining ground in Yemen, But the White House faces a tough decision as it seeks to preserve limited influence that it still has on the ground in Yemen. \u201dIf we were forced to close down in Sanaa, the embassy, this would be a major foreign policy defeat,\u201d CNN intelligence analyst Robert Baer told Wolf Blitzer. \u201dWe need a government in that country to crack down on al Qaeda. You cannot do this from the air, or the National Security Agency [cannot just] intercept intelligence. \u201dWe need a strong central government    whether it is a Houthi one or an independent one.\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the safety of embassy personnel in Sanaa was a top priority. He also made clear that preserving   cooperation in Yemen was also vital. But the   U. S. diplomatic posture in Yemen is unclear. The fact that al Qaeda is a common enemy of Washington and the Houthis raises the intriguing suggestion of possible cooperation. But any tie up would likely be tacit and covert, and Washington would have trouble publicly recognizing any Houthi regime.  Mohammed Albasha, a spokesman for the Yemeni embassy in Washington said, \u201dAmericans should care about the Houthis.\u201d \u201dWe need to find out a way for the Houthis and the government to   . .. they are now a fact of life,\u201d he told CNN. Charles Schmitz, an expert on Yemen and professor at Towson University, said the fallout from the apparent coup against Hadi was a mixed bag for the United States. \u201dThe Houthi are virulently   Qaeda. They have gone after al Qaeda like no one has before. There is a certain coincidence of interest with the U. S. with the Houthis against al Qaeda,\u201d he said. \u201dThe Houthi have done nothing to even slightly irritate the Americans. they have been very careful not to do anything like that. The Americans are very much leaving the door open.\u201d READ: PM Valls sets out sweeping measures to safeguard France, Kamran Bokhari, an adviser on Middle Eastern and South Asian Affairs for Stratfor, a global intelligence and advisory firm, said that the Houthi movement could not be ignored. \u201dIt is not clear to me to what extent Washington has relations with the Houthi movement. But now effectively the Houthis are kingmakers. While they do not dominate Yemen, they control the largest piece of real estate and they are the   group,\u201d Bokhari said. The level of Iran\u2019s support for the Houthi movement, beyond rhetorical backing is in question. Tehran\u2019s intelligence resources are already stretched by the Syrian crisis and its finances have been hampered by western nuclear sanctions and the fall in the price of oil. Iran, however, has spent years spreading its influence throughout the region in its wider proxy battle with its rival Saudi Arabia, an important U. S. ally, and now sponsors or heavily influences governments or key political forces in Damascus, Beirut and Baghdad, as well as Sanaa.  The complex web of tribal and sectarian forces scrambling alliances and traditional alliances in Yemen represent the region in microcosm and reflects massive challenges facing U. S. officials in search of a working policy. \u201dWe don\u2019t have a lot of leverage in there at the moment,\u201d Seche said. \u201dThere are so many forces and counter forces at play    none of which we or anyone controls effectively,\u201d he said. \u201dThere are currents and issues and long standing hostility they are going to have to work themselves to some extent.\u201d As violence flares, 7 things to know about Yemen","41":"\u2019  \u2019 \u2019   Philando Castile,  was   shot and killed by a police officer during a traffic   stop late Wednesday night.  \u2019 \u2019   In the only video evidence of the incident, a live Facebook   recording taken by Castile\u2019\u2019s girlfriend, Diamond \u201dLavish\u201d   Reynolds, she said the two were pulled over for a broken   taillight and that Castile told the officer he had a gun and was   reaching for his license and registration, as the officer   instructed. \u2019 \u201d   Still, the officer opened fire, ultimately leading to Castile\u2019s   death later that night at a hospital.

Trump and Hillary Clinton, interrupting each other and sometimes raising their voices, engaged in an angry debate on Thursday about how Mr. Trump pulled off his upset victory. Emotions were still raw at the campaign   held at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics, particularly over the influence of Stephen K. Bannon, who left Breitbart News  \u2014   which he has called a \u201cplatform\u201d for the white nationalist    \u2014   to help run Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Mr. Bannon will serve as a senior aide to Mr. Trump. David Bossie, Mr. Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager, called Mr. Bannon a \u201cbrilliant strategist. \u201d That provoked the Clinton campaign\u2019s director of communications, Jennifer Palmieri, to respond, \u201cIf providing a platform for white supremacists makes me a brilliant tactician, I am more proud to have lost. \u201d Mr. Bannon was scheduled to participate in the event but did not attend. That did not stop several hundred demonstrators from protesting him Wednesday evening outside Harvard\u2019s John F. Kennedy School of Government, where the   was held as part of a   conference. With campaign managers and pollsters talking over one another and a large crowd of campaign veterans from the news media looking on, Ms. Palmieri said her proudest moment from the campaign was a speech Mrs. Clinton gave in Nevada condemning the  . \u201cI would rather lose than win the way you guys did,\u201d Ms. Palmieri said. Kellyanne Conway, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s third and final campaign manager, asked, \u201cHow exactly did we win?\u201d She answered her own question: by connecting with voters in places \u201cwhere we were either ignored or mocked roundly by most of the people in this room. \u201d \u201cDo you think I ran a campaign where white supremacists had a platform?\u201d Ms. Conway asked Ms. Palmieri. \u201cYou\u2019re going to look me in the face and tell me that?\u201d Ms. Conway went on, pointing out Mrs. Clinton\u2019s failings. \u201cDo you think you could have just had a decent message for the white   voters?\u201d she asked the Clinton advisers. \u201cHow about it\u2019s Hillary Clinton, she doesn\u2019t connect with people? How about they had nothing in common with her? How about you had no economic message?\u201d Joel Benenson, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s pollster, accused the Trump campaign of using \u201cdog whistles\u201d about immigrants and minorities to appeal to white voters in battleground states. Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, disputed the notion that Mr. Trump won primarily by appealing on economic issues, citing exit polls in Michigan and Wisconsin showing Mrs. Clinton carried more voters who ranked the economy as their top issue. The highly charged exchange was followed by a more restrained conversation between Ms. Conway and Mr. Mook, moderated by the CNN host Jake Tapper. CNN will broadcast the discussion on Sunday. But it was the more raucous session earlier in the day where the passions of the campaign still seemed at a barely contained boil. The participants, half a dozen from each campaign who faced each other while seated at two tables, argued about whether Mr. Trump had won a mandate. \u201cYou won the Electoral College don\u2019t pretend you have a mandate,\u201d Mr. Benenson said. \u201cTwo and a half million more Americans thought she was a better candidate. \u201d \u201cHey guys,\u201d Ms. Conway replied. \u201cWe won. Why is there no mandate?\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers argued repeatedly that two public letters by James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails less than two weeks before Election Day pushed enough undecided voters away from her to swing the election. They also said that voters were seeking fundamental change in Washington, a strong headwind Mrs. Clinton could never overcome. In a rare point of agreement, both campaigns faulted the news media. They said leading newspapers and TV networks were so convinced Mr. Trump was unelectable that they never took him seriously. That led to \u201c \u201d on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, Mr. Mook said. \u201cMr. Trump had a unique ability to speak directly to the American people and go past the media, whether in 140 characters or making a statement somewhere,\u201d Mr. Bossie said. The Trump strategists repeatedly said the Clinton campaign had tried to disqualify Mr. Trump based on his temperament and statements, while misunderstanding the appeal of his promise to keep Americans safe from terrorism at home and abroad. \u201cThey wanted to frame the race as, \u2018Do you trust him to have his finger on the button? \u2019\u201d said Tony Fabrizio, Mr. Trump\u2019s pollster. \u201cAt the end of the day, what a lot of voters didn\u2019t buy was that it was ever going to be a time where you have to worry about his finger on the button,\u201d he said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t Barry Goldwater. \u201d Asked by Mr. Tapper whether Mr. Trump\u2019s recent posting of misinformation on Twitter about millions of undocumented immigrants voting was presidential, Ms. Conway defended the message. \u201cHe\u2019s the   so that\u2019s presidential behavior,\u201d she said. At one point, Ms. Conway threw up her hands in frustration at the close scrutiny of the campaign. \u201cEverybody wants to go back in a time machine and do things differently so this result that nobody saw coming won\u2019t come somehow,\u201d she said.","46":"I walked out of Tokyo Station, the big commuter hub in the city\u2019s Chiyoda district, and turned to look up at its gorgeous brick facade. I was lost. I couldn\u2019t find the Tokyo Station Hotel  \u2014   a   luxury property that was renovated in 2012. My mistake, it turned out, was leaving the train station at all. The hotel and the train station coexist in one long, outstretched building, which was completed in 1914 and offers a refreshing prewar architectural counterpoint to the glittering    skyscrapers Tokyo is now known for. I looped back in and found the hotel\u2019s lobby, as well as its chief concierge, Marie Antoinette Mori, who greeted me at her desk. Originally from the Philippines, Ms. Mori became fascinated with Japan during its big 1980s economic boom. She studied international tourism in Japan, married a Japanese man and began working in the hospitality industry, where her career took off. \u201cI became one of the favorites of Mr. Stringer\u201d  \u2014   the former Sony chairman Howard Stringer. \u201cI was the only one who wasn\u2019t afraid of him,\u201d she said with a laugh. Ms. Mori had prepared an itinerary for a fictitious guest, spending $1, 000 (about 110, 000 yen) over the course of a day in this   city. My goal was to remake the itinerary on a budget of $100  \u2014   necessarily cutting a few corners, but hoping to retain the spirit of the original. HIGH Ms. Mori escorted me to the top floor of her hotel, into a huge room where sunlight flooded in through large skylights. Guests grazed on a large, comprehensive morning buffet. Ms. Mori recommended the Tokyo Station Hotel breakfast (3, 800 yen) where they could enjoy standard Western fare (eggs made to order, coffee, pastries) or regional Japanese staples, where the Tokyo Station really excels:   (hot pot from the northern Hokkaido region) traditional rice porridge, soybean milk skin, and boiled rape blossoms. Ms. Mori said many luxury hotels in the area had comparable buffets. The   she said, specializes in pastries. \u201cOver there they have a, uh   \u2026     what do you call it?\u201d she asked. \u201cA Cronut. \u201d LOW From one buffet in a huge train station to another, I went to the considerably cheaper Bar Marche Kodama in the Shinagawa train station in the Minato ward. It\u2019s also a little tricky to find: Don\u2019t exit the station once you get off at the Shinagawa stop. Go into the Ecute department store and you\u2019ll find the small restaurant in the back corner. Once there, I feasted on an eclectic, mostly   buffet of prosciutto, green salad, fresh corn, pasta Bolognese, crispy fried rice and, for dessert, Italian wedding cookies. The inclusion of the salad was particularly nice  \u2014   Japanese cuisine is healthy, but not necessarily heavy on raw, leafy greens. Total cost: 620 yen. HIGH Ms. Mori quoted a price of roughly 15, 000 yen to have a private sedan with a driver for three hours to ferry our faux   around the city. The Tokyo Station Hotel goes so far as to meet guests at train platforms and escort them to the hotel  \u2014   a service that comes only with staying at the hotel, of course, which can run over $1, 000 per night. LOW Logistics are tricky for those unfamiliar with the city. Get to know and love the train, because you\u2019ll be spending quite a bit of time with it. Tokyo\u2019s system is expansive and can be, in a word, daunting. There are over 100 different railway lines in Tokyo, and most of them are privately held by competing companies. The two big ones you\u2019ll need to know are JR East, the largest railway system in Japan, and the Tokyo Metro, the city\u2019s busiest subway system. If you\u2019re planning to use only the subway or JR lines, there are passes for that. A combination ticket, though (which can be purchased in JR stations) is the better way to go. For 1, 590 yen, you\u2019ll be able to use several lines for one day, including all of Tokyo\u2019s JR lines and the Tokyo Metro. Another option is to buy a Suica or Pasmo card (available at ticket vending machines in major train stations) reusable cards on which you load money you touch them to the turnstile each time you ride. There is a   deposit to pick up one of those cards, but it\u2019s worth it  \u2014   you won\u2019t have to deal with individual tickets, you\u2019ll get a small discount on rides and you can even use it to make purchases in some stores and at the city\u2019s ubiquitous vending machines. Related pro tip Get a SIM card for your phone  \u2014   data only. You won\u2019t want to be without a maps app when you\u2019re walking around. Cards in the $15 to $20 range are widely available. (Make sure you get the right size: the   iPhones, for example, use nano SIM cards, not micro SIM.) HIGH The Asakusa neighborhood is known for its Sensoji Buddhist temple, Tokyo\u2019s oldest. Ms. Mori recommended a rickshaw tour of the neighborhood, passing along Sumida Park, one of the many places in Tokyo to see sakura, or cherry blossoms, in the early spring. A   tour costs 16, 250 yen. LOW I set out to do some exploring on my own, and see some sakura in the process. A follower of the Frugal Traveler Twitter account recommended the Nezu Museum in the Minato district. While the Nezu\u2019s collection of Buddhist art and Chinese bronzes was interesting, I was most impressed with the lush garden out back. The garden  \u2014   about four acres  \u2014   is shockingly big in a place where space is so precious. It truly feels like an escape from the city. Admission was 1, 000 yen. From there, I hopped a couple of trains over to the Korakuen station and walked up to the University of Tokyo\u2019s Koishikawa Botanical Gardens. After paying admission (400 yen) I headed from the southeast entrance to a huge open expanse in the center of the garden. I found families picnicking, children playing and people lining up for coffee and tea from the ramshackle snack bar called Coffee Time (a coffee is 300 yen). All were enjoying the budding cherry blossoms and cool spring weather. HIGH Ms. Mori recommended the omakase tasting menu at  \u2014   where else?  \u2014   Sukiyabashi Jiro. The    sushi master Jiro Ono\u2019s already formidable status was made outright legendary with the release of the 2012 documentary \u201cJiro Dreams of Sushi. \u201d The   restaurant is difficult to get into, but Ms. Mori can make the arrangements. \u201cWe can get you into Jiro,\u201d she said, \u201cbut then you have to go. You have to. We can\u2019t have   at Jiro. \u201d The price for lunch (or dinner) is 30, 000 yen. LOW Jiro received three Michelin stars Tsuta received one. It was the first Japanese ramen shop ever to receive such an honor. The small, unassuming space, close to the Sugamo station on the JR Yamanote line, is difficult to get into for different reasons: They take no reservations and operate on a ticket system. I went early one morning, around 7:30 a. m. and waited outside the restaurant with a handful of other people. Eventually the door slid open and a man came out with a handful of small, laminated tickets. He handed me one: \u201cCome back,\u201d he said. \u201cBetween 12 and 1 p. m. \u201d He took a   bill as a deposit, then went back inside and closed the door. When I returned at noon, I was treated to the best bowl of shoyu (soy  ) ramen I\u2019d ever eaten. The broth was deep, intense and slightly sweet. The accompaniments  \u2014     egg, bamboo shoots and pork slices  \u2014   were done perfectly. The basic ramen bowl at Tsuta is 950 yen  \u2014   I paid a total of 1, 250 for three extra slices of pork. HIGH Who doesn\u2019t like a little costume play built into their vacations? Ms. Mori recommended something called a \u201ckimono experience and photo shoot,\u201d wherein the patron pays for elaborate kimono dress (in one of several styles: oiran, maiko or geisha) as well as hair and makeup. A photo shoot follows. Men, don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting out of this: There\u2019s a samurai option for you. The oiran set with two kimonos costs 27, 000 yen. LOW I found a different way to incorporate both ceremonial clothing (of sorts) and culture into my visit: taking in a Japanese baseball game. I bought my ticket at one of the many   in Japan. (  is owned by a Japanese company.) It was a complicated process, one that involved a helpful clerk trying to spell my name in the Japanese alphabet  \u2014   buying at the stadium probably would have been easier. It also involved deciding what \u201ccheering section\u201d I wanted to sit in. I decided on an outfield ticket on the side of the home team, the Tokyo Yakult Swallows. The game was positively raucous  \u2014   at one point, everyone in my section produced tiny umbrellas and began thrusting them up and down and chanting (a   chant, I assumed) while a small brass band backed them up. The stadium grub selection was great, too  \u2014   a big bowl of ramen could be had for 750 yen, yakitori for 100 yen, and a whiskey and melon soda for 600 yen. My ticket cost a reasonable 1, 800 yen. HIGH Seiji Yamamoto is the chef at Nihonryori RyuGin, a modern kaiseki restaurant that was awarded three Michelin stars. Mr. Yamamoto is known for incorporating modern culinary techniques with the refined, traditional kaiseki dinner. The descriptions of RyuGin\u2019s courses are wonderfully abstract: Dishes have names like \u201cCoolness Warmth Playfulness Nostalgia and Temptation\u201d and \u201cA Message From the Coast of Japan. \u201d Dinner costs 27, 000 yen. LOW I was also in search of a taste of the coast of Japan, in the form of a sushi dinner. I met up with my friend Mayumi, a Tokyo native, and presented her with my annoyingly specific parameters: something good but not that good cheap but definitely not poor quality. She   took me to a small place near the Kyodo train station in her neighborhood, about a   ride from Shinjuku: Midori Sushi, an unpretentious restaurant next to a KFC. The chef Ken Hosono\u2019s   omakase menu featured an exceptionally   squid, along with barracuda, fatty tuna, uni and a wonderfully buttery scallop, among other pieces. The cost was 3, 000 yen per person. Not only was it one of best sushi dinners I\u2019ve had in recent memory, but it was among the cheapest  \u2014   a    sweet spot that every frugal traveler seeks out.","47":"Was that a     double play?! @SportsCenter #SCtop10 pic. twitter.  Thursday, Cincinnati Reds class A team Dayton Dragons made one of the craziest plays you may see in baseball.  South Bend Cubs infielder P. J.

Got a tip? Call     (In Mexico: 0188000990546) or click here. Abducted two days earlier by two men she didn\u2019t know, the    had spent most of the previous 48 hours chained to a bed in a room with a barred window. Held captive, she was tortured and raped repeatedly. But on a trip to the bathroom, she spotted another window, this one without bars.   \u201dThat was my first bit of hope, like, \u2019Oh, I can maybe get out,\u2019\u201d Hood said of the moment on CNN\u2019s \u201dThe Hunt with John Walsh.\u201d Her captors had wanted her to read a book about subservient women. She told them she would, and they unchained one of her hands to turn the pages. Left alone, she quickly freed her arm and other legs, grabbed one of the many firearms around the house and ran for the window, for freedom. She smashed the window with the gun, climbed through the broken glass and started running. \u201dOne of the guys was yelling, \u2019Get her, get her, she can\u2019t get away!\u2019 \u201d Hood said.  \u201dI ran down the street hysterically crying, and bleeding all over. I was scared that they were literally right behind me.\u201d CNN\u2019s John Walsh believes Hood\u2019s decisive action that night may be the reason she\u2019s alive today. \u201dHere\u2019s a vulnerable    girl that was smart enough, tough enough, had the presence of mind to say, \u2019I\u2019m going to stay alive. I\u2019m going to look for that chance,\u2019 and that\u2019s what saved her life,\u201d he said. Inside the torture house, Hood found her way to the police and learned she was in Hillsboro, Oregon, 17 miles west of Portland, where she had been picked up by the men two days earlier.  It was 1990. Hood had been working as a prostitute on the streets of Portland to pay for her drug habit. It was around 2 or 3 in the morning when the men pulled up in a small pickup truck. \u201dBefore I knew what was even happening, I was in the back of the truck, chained to the bed of the truck, and with a pillowcase on my head and duct tape on my mouth,\u201d Hood told \u201dThe Hunt.\u201d Now she had been treated for her injuries, and was driving around with law enforcement, leading them back to the torture house she had escaped only hours earlier. There, the police found the broken window with the rifle Hood used to break it outside on the ground. Inside, they discovered more evidence supporting her account, including Polaroid photos of other women in bondage, as well as photos of Hood. After searching the Hillsboro house, police arrested the home\u2019s owner, Vance Roberts, and his   Paul Jackson. That night, the pair had driven their pickup truck to a hospital, where Roberts received medical attention for a cut on his arm. In his version of events, Hood had been trying to steal from them, which is why she jumped out the window and how Vance got his injury. The photos? Old girlfriends, he claimed. A previous victim steps forward, To this day, many of the other women in those photos have not been located or identified. One has: Michaelle Dierich. Like Hood, she was a Portland prostitute with a drug habit.  Two years before Hood\u2019s ordeal, Dierich went through almost the same experience: abducted by two men in a pickup truck, chained up in a closet, sexually tortured and brutalized for days. After a week of this treatment, the younger man threw a hood over her head again and put her back in the truck.  Dierich assumed they were planning to kill her. Instead, she was dropped off on a street in Portland. Dierich went to the hospital and was interviewed by police. She filled out a report and submitted a rape kit. But she could not tell them where she\u2019d been taken, or by whom.  Lacking enough evidence to launch a detailed investigation, the report was filed away and nothing else happened    until Hood\u2019s case came to light. The Hillsboro police found Dierich with the help of the Portland police. She identified Roberts and Jackson as her abductors from 1988. Armed with two witnesses and hard evidence, prosecutors charged the brothers with kidnapping and rape.  A trial date was set, but in February 1991, Roberts and Jackson, who were free on bond, fled. Roberts returns to face justice, In September 2006, after 15 years on the run, Vance Roberts unexpectedly walked into the Washington County Jail and turned himself in.  He claimed to have been living under bridges in Portland, but police didn\u2019t believe his story.  They were unsuccessful in getting any more information from him.  At his trial, Roberts insisted the women had stayed with him voluntarily.   Hillsboro sergeant Bruce Parks recalled the trial: \u201dThe defense tried to victimize the two women. They may have committed a small crime by working on the street as a prostitute, but they never agreed to be kidnapped. They\u2019re still human beings.\u201d The jury didn\u2019t buy it, and after finding Roberts guilty, sentenced him to 108 years in prison.  Hood said she feels vindicated by the verdict. \u201d[H]e gets to spend the rest of his life in a situation of subservience. He\u2019s told when to use the bathroom, when to eat, what he can do, just like they had planned for me, and I felt like that was just.\u201d On the day of the sentencing, Dierich took the stand and confronted Roberts about the women in the photos whose identities and whereabouts are still unknown.  \u201dYou brutalized me you terrorized me. You left me mentally and emotionally crippled beyond words or expression.   \u201dIt wasn\u2019t just me, though. Indeed there were many other victims, more victims than we may know about today.  \u201dEverybody knows about the 10 other victims. So, I\u2019d like to know where their bodies at?\u201d The hunt for Paul Jackson, Since his return in 2006, Vance Roberts has never turned on his brother, or said anything about Paul Jackson\u2019s whereabouts.  Jackson is still on the run, 23 years since he jumped bail.   Deputy U. S. Marshal John Moody hopes the exposure given to the case by CNN\u2019s \u201dThe Hunt\u201d will bring forth new leads. \u201dThe biggest thing that we\u2019re looking for is someone to come forward that they\u2019ve, maybe this has happened to them and they escaped from it,\u201d he said. \u201dWe\u2019d like to hear from them. They may have a piece to the puzzle to get this creature off the streets.\u201d Paul Jackson has a scar on his stomach from having his appendix removed. Jackson has lived in both Arizona and Hawaii and has a background in electronic and automotive work. If you\u2019ve seen Paul Jackson or know anything about his whereabouts, please call     or go to our website at CNN. . You can remain anonymous.
