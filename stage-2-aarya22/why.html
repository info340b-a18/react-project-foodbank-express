                                        In the past we only had a few sources of information to worry about. This included but was not limited to:
                                        <ul id="pastList">
                                            <li>Local Gossip</li>
                                            <li>Word of Mouth Communication</li>
                                            <li>Occasional "town crier" spreading news of important events happening in the world</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        Though primitive compared to our complex media landscapes (more on that later), these sources functioned as primary sources of information for a given citizen’s concern. Town criers made sure that a given citizen was 
                                        informed about the general happenings in a land, such as an important lord’s death or a new and upcoming military campaign that promised a worthy escape and career to ambitious and hardy young men. Word of mouth communication 
                                        kept one informed of the general goings on in the village and community and local gossip was spread for the purpose of keeping people informed about events within personal lives to self-police the small community.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Even with the advances in technology such as the advent of newspapers and inventions such as the printing press, word spread on a more national level but still at a snail’s pace. While this was the beginning of the media 
                                        complexes we have today the collection, report, printing, and distribution of information was done by hand for the most part. But far more important than the relative speed of printing presses, newspapers, and local gossips 
                                        were the limited viewpoints presented to a citizen. They only had access to what was available to them, and for the majority of the population that lived outside of metropolitan areas where media and information congregates, 
                                        this did not represent much of the population. With limited viewpoints at their disposal, citizens were amenable to being “convinced” by an interested political, economic, or military party that a certain viewpoint was most 
                                        advantageous to take. An example of this can be seen in the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-woodrow-wilsons-propaganda-machine-changed-american-journalism-180963082/">Creel Commission</a> where the pro-war 
                                        Woodrow Wilson administration convinced a relatively pacifistic American population to whole-heartedly support a total-war against the German population. <b>By limiting our viewpoints, we citizens open ourselves to influence from 
                                        major parties that may or may not have our interests in mind.</b>

                                        To combat such limiting and propagandistic viewpoints from blocs that may have ulterior motives in mind, it is necessary for today’s citizens to arm themselves with a variety of viewpoints that prevent them from falling prey to 
                                        media landscapes designed to sell them more products rather than explain the truth as it is. With the rise of mass-media in our present landscape, citizens have more viewpoints than ever before to exercise and understand the world
                                        around them. Though for the first time we have a variety of viewpoints and different interpretations of any current event, citizens prefer instead to receive their news from their

                                        and often entirely miss exposure to certain critical news stories because the algorithms believe the user would not like to see it. For example, <a href="http://webfoundation.org/docs/2018/04/WF_InvisibleCurationContent_Screen_AW.pdf">a recent study</a>
                                        by the World Wide Web Foundation found that many stories had been cut out for users with different political and social leanings, even when subscribed to the same page. Not only does this create an echo chamber for the average internet user, but it 
                                        deliberately misguides its users when they subscribe to a given page.

                                    <p><em>In order to make informed decisions, citizens need the ability to at least understand issues from a bird’s eye view from all sides of a given issue.</em></p>

                                        With this deliberate use of holding information and the rise of trends such as "Fake News" to influence the world's citizens and leaders on a sociopolitical level, it is necessary to develop tools that help us see 
                                        the world as it is. Now more than ever, the average citizen has access to the truths of the events surrounding them. Citizens must adopt a viewpoint of impartiality and be able to aggregate information and viewpoints 
                                        without "personalized" algorithms worrying about how likely they are to like and share the article they just recieved. <a href="index.html">Symposia</a> seeks to subvert the narratives defined by the wider media by exposing their positions from a
                                        bird’s eye view for a given position. By showing a major news networks position from a grander view, we hope citizens can approach their media landscape with a map of where to go and what to look for.
