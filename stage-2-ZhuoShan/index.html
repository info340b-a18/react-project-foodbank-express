                <h1>Food Waste Problem</h1>
                <p>Between <b><a href="https://www.usda.gov/oce/foodwaste/faqs.htm">30-55%</a></b> of all food produced globally is never eaten, and the value of 
                this wasted food is worth over <b><a href="http://www.fao.org/save-food/resources/keyfindings/en/">1 trillion dollar</a></b>. Food waste is a massive market inefficiency.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, approximately <b><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/06/06/189192870/when-you-waste-food-youre-wasting-tons-of-water-too">25%</a></b> of all fresh water consumption globally goes to the production of wasted food.
                    Not only are all the resources went into creating the uneaten food wasted, but the decomposition of food waste
                    creates massive amount of air pollution.
                </p>
                <p>It is easy for many people to dismiss food waste as someone else's problem as they argue that they do not waste food.
                    However, The reality is that in the developed contries, more than <b><a href="http://www.fao.org/save-food/resources/keyfindings/en/">40%</a></b> of food waste takes place in our homes.

                <h1>Food Banks</h1>
                <p>Food banks are at the forefront of the day-to-day fight against food waste. For more than 30 years, European food banks have
                    provided, and continue to provide, solutions to solve poverty, hunger and food waste challenges. 
                </p>
                <p>Food banks collect edible food from companies, including manufacturers, retailers, as well as individuals. The food is then stored and sorted 
                    to prepare nutritionally balanced mean packages. 
                </p>
                <p>Thanks to food donations, a large quantity of edible food that would have gone to a landfill, creating emissions
                     and wasting water and energy, is now being consumed by thoes most in need. 
                </p>
                <p>However, many local food banks are experiencing low volume of donations. And food donations, in general, have been 
                    declining. One of the primary sources of food donation has gone down over the year. Food donations that come in 
                    via the postal service have been on the decline. Local food banks in Washington State cannot keep up the demand.
